<transcript>
<text start="12.38" dur="8.05">
thank you hi everybody so I&#39;m here today
</text>
<text start="17.4" dur="5.1">
to talk to you well I&#39;m not a very
</text>
<text start="20.43" dur="4.29">
cheerful emission really I&#39;m here to
</text>
<text start="22.5" dur="4.05">
talk to you about three terrible awful
</text>
<text start="24.72" dur="4.2">
mistakes that I think that you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="26.55" dur="4.02">
probably making in your work lives and
</text>
<text start="28.92" dur="3.72">
quite possibly in your personal
</text>
<text start="30.57" dur="3.39">
relationships as well but the good news
</text>
<text start="32.64" dur="3.24">
is that I&#39;m also going to tell you how
</text>
<text start="33.96" dur="3.599">
to fix these mistakes and I&#39;m just gonna
</text>
<text start="35.88" dur="5.73">
jump right in and tell you what these
</text>
<text start="37.559" dur="11.491">
mistakes are oh shoot I think these
</text>
<text start="41.61" dur="9.48">
slides are sorry bear with me a second
</text>
<text start="49.05" dur="3.689">
because my slide deck is all the way at
</text>
<text start="51.09" dur="3.51">
the end instead of at the beginning so
</text>
<text start="52.739" dur="3.691">
I&#39;m going to try to quickly get back
</text>
<text start="54.6" dur="9.529">
there and then we&#39;ll take it from the
</text>
<text start="56.43" dur="7.699">top oh dear</text>
<text start="64.96" dur="5.71">
and I can probably I mean I can do this
</text>
<text start="68.24" dur="10.26">
without slides if we can&#39;t actually make
</text>
<text start="70.67" dur="9.92">it happen huh okay you know what I think</text>
<text start="78.5" dur="4.439">
I&#39;m going to do this without slides
</text>
<text start="80.59" dur="5.979">
unless there&#39;s someone who can fix it in
</text>
<text start="82.939" dur="5.011">
the next 30 seconds okay we&#39;re going to
</text>
<text start="86.569" dur="6.931">
do this without slides and that&#39;s okay
</text>
<text start="87.95" dur="7.559">
all right so mistake number one a third
</text>
<text start="93.5" dur="3.899">
to a half of us are introverts a third
</text>
<text start="95.509" dur="3.57">
to a half the most recent study actually
</text>
<text start="97.399" dur="4.47">
says that it is 50% of the population
</text>
<text start="99.079" dur="4.14">
which I know seems shocking you know it
</text>
<text start="101.869" dur="3.661">
doesn&#39;t feel as if half of us are
</text>
<text start="103.219" dur="4.5">
introverted but this is because so many
</text>
<text start="105.53" dur="3.36">
introverts are told from the time
</text>
<text start="107.719" dur="3.72">
they&#39;re very little children that they
</text>
<text start="108.89" dur="4.289">
should be acting more like extroverts
</text>
<text start="111.439" dur="3.451">
and so they learn how to do it but the
</text>
<text start="113.179" dur="3.72">
fact remains you know inside that&#39;s who
</text>
<text start="114.89" dur="3.81">
they are and in many ways we are not
</text>
<text start="116.899" dur="3.06">
getting the best of our introverts
</text>
<text start="118.7" dur="4.169">
hearts and brains and I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="119.959" dur="4.681">
explain to you why that is but this is
</text>
<text start="122.869" dur="4.59">
also really important because if you
</text>
<text start="124.64" dur="5.58">
think about it introverts really are
</text>
<text start="127.459" dur="5.31">
they&#39;re roughly kind of where women were
</text>
<text start="130.22" dur="4.919">
in the 1950s you know it&#39;s sort of half
</text>
<text start="132.769" dur="4.981">
the population undervalued for a trait
</text>
<text start="135.139" dur="3.991">
that goes to the core of who we are and
</text>
<text start="137.75" dur="2.88">
we are failing to maximize their
</text>
<text start="139.13" dur="4.439">
potential and we will all be better off
</text>
<text start="140.63" dur="6.54">
if we start getting it right okay
</text>
<text start="143.569" dur="5.54">
mistake number two whether or not you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="147.17" dur="4.289">
an introvert or an extrovert yourself
</text>
<text start="149.109" dur="4.541">
whether or not you&#39;re an introvert or an
</text>
<text start="151.459" dur="4.381">
extrovert you are spending way too much
</text>
<text start="153.65" dur="4.739">
time in meetings and not enough time
</text>
<text start="155.84" dur="4.17">
alone and this is seriously interfering
</text>
<text start="158.389" dur="6.741">
with your ability to be creative and
</text>
<text start="160.01" dur="8.309">
I&#39;ll explain why mistake number three
</text>
<text start="165.13" dur="5.62">
many of you assume perhaps unconsciously
</text>
<text start="168.319" dur="5.01">
that the most assertive talkers have the
</text>
<text start="170.75" dur="4.859">best ideas when in fact there&#39;s zero</text>
<text start="173.329" dur="3.961">
correlation between these two things so
</text>
<text start="175.609" dur="3.181">you know you assertive talkers you might</text>
<text start="177.29" dur="3.33">
have the best ideas at any given moment
</text>
<text start="178.79" dur="4.759">
and you may not you know it&#39;s up to
</text>
<text start="180.62" dur="7.5">
chance so we have to figure out ways of
</text>
<text start="183.549" dur="6.131">
of hearing from all sides okay I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="188.12" dur="4.66">
to get into each of these three mistakes
</text>
<text start="189.68" dur="5.779">
but before we do that I want to
</text>
<text start="192.78" dur="4.42">just kind of everybody together</text>
<text start="195.459" dur="3.601">
understand what do we actually mean by
</text>
<text start="197.2" dur="3.45">an introvert or an extrovert what do</text>
<text start="199.06" dur="3.659">
these terms mean and more importantly
</text>
<text start="200.65" dur="3.99">
you know who are you where do you each
</text>
<text start="202.719" dur="4.561">
of you personally fall on this introvert
</text>
<text start="204.64" dur="4.349">
extrovert spectrum so to get at this
</text>
<text start="207.28" dur="4.26">
question we&#39;re going to do something
</text>
<text start="208.989" dur="5.071">
just a little bit unorthodox I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="211.54" dur="4.44">
to ask you each to form groups of four
</text>
<text start="214.06" dur="4.94">
with people sitting next to you and then
</text>
<text start="215.98" dur="5.28">
I&#39;m going to ask you to take a memory
</text>
<text start="219" dur="4.48">
from your childhood that you think
</text>
<text start="221.26" dur="3.569">
illustrates the real you and then we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="223.48" dur="3">
going to ask each group to select the
</text>
<text start="224.829" dur="3.421">
most personal private and poignant of
</text>
<text start="226.48" dur="3.119">
each of these memories and share them
</text>
<text start="228.25" dur="3.659">
with the audience at large and in the
</text>
<text start="229.599" dur="5.54">
hope that out of this process a larger
</text>
<text start="231.909" dur="3.23">truth will emerge</text>
<text start="238.22" dur="12.8">
yeah I&#39;m just kidding um we&#39;re not
</text>
<text start="243.02" dur="8">
really gonna do any such thing yeah
</text>
<text start="251.59" dur="3.73">
we&#39;re not going to do any such thing but
</text>
<text start="253.7" dur="4.319">
I want you to think for a minute about
</text>
<text start="255.32" dur="4.77">
what were you thinking and feeling for
</text>
<text start="258.019" dur="4.501">
the brief 20 seconds where you thought
</text>
<text start="260.09" dur="4.77">
she&#39;s actually serious about this where
</text>
<text start="262.52" dur="3.99">
are you thinking actually this is kind
</text>
<text start="264.86" dur="3.39">
of nice you know a chance to chat with
</text>
<text start="266.51" dur="4.29">
my colleagues a little bit more instead
</text>
<text start="268.25" dur="5.52">
of listening passively to a speech or
</text>
<text start="270.8" dur="4.41">
were you thinking how can I get out of
</text>
<text start="273.77" dur="4.77">
here right now without insulting the
</text>
<text start="275.21" dur="4.77">
speaker and if you&#39;re feeling that way
</text>
<text start="278.54" dur="3.75">
you might be more on the introverted
</text>
<text start="279.98" dur="5.04">
side of the spectrum you know introverts
</text>
<text start="282.29" dur="4.8">
are forever being obliged to participate
</text>
<text start="285.02" dur="4.05">
in these kinds of group processing
</text>
<text start="287.09" dur="3.48">events and they tend not to like them</text>
<text start="289.07" dur="3.57">
very much which is not to say that
</text>
<text start="290.57" dur="3.72">
introverts don&#39;t make really great team
</text>
<text start="292.64" dur="3.72">
members introverts actually tend to be
</text>
<text start="294.29" dur="3.63">
quite cooperative and enjoy working in
</text>
<text start="296.36" dur="3.72">
teams but they don&#39;t tend to like these
</text>
<text start="297.92" dur="5.52">
kinds of spontaneous groupings for their
</text>
<text start="300.08" dur="5.01">
own sake okay another way to think about
</text>
<text start="303.44" dur="3.9">
who you are are you more of an introvert
</text>
<text start="305.09" dur="4.56">
or an extrovert a lot of it just had it
</text>
<text start="307.34" dur="4.53">
has to do with where do I get my energy
</text>
<text start="309.65" dur="3.9">
where do you get your energy and I want
</text>
<text start="311.87" dur="3.99">
you to imagine for a minute that you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="313.55" dur="3.78">
at a party and imagine it&#39;s a really
</text>
<text start="315.86" dur="1.83">
terrific party and you&#39;re having a great
</text>
<text start="317.33" dur="2.1">time</text>
<text start="317.69" dur="4.71">
and you&#39;re talking to people who you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="319.43" dur="5.4">
enjoying and everything&#39;s all good but
</text>
<text start="322.4" dur="4.95">
still what happens after an hour and a
</text>
<text start="324.83" dur="4.77">
half or two hours are you feeling like
</text>
<text start="327.35" dur="4.95">
well I&#39;m really revved up by this and so
</text>
<text start="329.6" dur="5.61">
now I want to socialize all the more or
</text>
<text start="332.3" dur="4.02">
are you thinking that you&#39;re starting to
</text>
<text start="335.21" dur="3.51">
wish to God that you were home in your
</text>
<text start="336.32" dur="4.2">
pajamas again that is something that
</text>
<text start="338.72" dur="4.11">
introverts tend to feel you know it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="340.52" dur="3.72">
just a kind of like you get to plead it
</text>
<text start="342.83" dur="3.39">
a little bit after you&#39;ve been out and
</text>
<text start="344.24" dur="9.33">
about and you get recharged by being
</text>
<text start="346.22" dur="8.97">
inside your own head okay so introverts
</text>
<text start="353.57" dur="3.36">
and extroverts very different
</text>
<text start="355.19" dur="10.3">
constellations of strengths
</text>
<text start="356.93" dur="10.85">
you know introverts oh thank you okay
</text>
<text start="365.49" dur="4.78">very different kinds of constellations</text>
<text start="367.78" dur="4.92">
of strength so introverts tend to be
</text>
<text start="370.27" dur="6.15">
very reflective they tend to focus
</text>
<text start="372.7" dur="5.58">
really well they tend to like delving
</text>
<text start="376.42" dur="4.02">
into subject and great depth and they&#39;re
</text>
<text start="378.28" dur="4.08">
really really persistent I mean we you
</text>
<text start="380.44" dur="3.45">
kind of know this in from your real life
</text>
<text start="382.36" dur="3.3">
experiences but it&#39;s been shown in the
</text>
<text start="383.89" dur="2.85">lab - you give introverts and extroverts</text>
<text start="385.66" dur="2.64">problems to solve</text>
<text start="386.74" dur="3.03">
you know the require sitting down and
</text>
<text start="388.3" dur="3.24">persistently working at them the</text>
<text start="389.77" dur="3.39">
introverts will work at them longer
</text>
<text start="391.54" dur="3.36">
that&#39;s just kind of their nature and in
</text>
<text start="393.16" dur="4.44">
fact Albert Einstein who is one of my
</text>
<text start="394.9" dur="5.1">
favorite introverted role models once
</text>
<text start="397.6" dur="5.73">
said it&#39;s not that I&#39;m so smart it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="400" dur="4.26">
that I stay with problems longer and you
</text>
<text start="403.33" dur="3.96">
can think of that really as an
</text>
<text start="404.26" dur="4.53">
introverted mantra now the extrovert
</text>
<text start="407.29" dur="3.06">
constellation of strengths it&#39;s kind of
</text>
<text start="408.79" dur="4.23">
different it&#39;s more about being you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="410.35" dur="5.63">
very buoyant and assertive and dynamic
</text>
<text start="413.02" dur="6.93">
and sociable and these kinds of things
</text>
<text start="415.98" dur="4.36">
but I want to say at talking about all
</text>
<text start="419.95" dur="5.36">this</text>
<text start="420.34" dur="6.99">
that what we really need are these two
</text>
<text start="425.31" dur="4.06">
constellations of strengths to be
</text>
<text start="427.33" dur="3.48">
equally valued and to come together and
</text>
<text start="429.37" dur="3.33">
to really work together you know to form
</text>
<text start="430.81" dur="3.09">
a kind of yin and yang instead of what I
</text>
<text start="432.7" dur="2.76">
believe we have right now which is a
</text>
<text start="433.9" dur="3.6">
kind of sort of personality chauvinism
</text>
<text start="435.46" dur="4.86">where the one constellation is seen as</text>
<text start="437.5" dur="4.74">
more important than the other once we
</text>
<text start="440.32" dur="3.45">
see them value once we start to value
</text>
<text start="442.24" dur="3.84">
them equally that&#39;s when we can really
</text>
<text start="443.77" dur="3.87">
start to form the partnership that we
</text>
<text start="446.08" dur="5.16">
need and I&#39;m going to give you an
</text>
<text start="447.64" dur="5.94">
example of such a partnership here it is
</text>
<text start="451.24" dur="4.56">
this is Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl
</text>
<text start="453.58" dur="4.41">
Sandberg who pretty much run Facebook
</text>
<text start="455.8" dur="5.73">together Mark Zuckerberg famous</text>
<text start="457.99" dur="5.82">
introvert and he explicitly hired Sheryl
</text>
<text start="461.53" dur="4.62">
Sandberg because he knew that he likes
</text>
<text start="463.81" dur="3.75">
to kind of go deep focus on strategy in
</text>
<text start="466.15" dur="3.24">
this kind of thing and he needed
</text>
<text start="467.56" dur="3.75">
somebody who could balance him out and
</text>
<text start="469.39" dur="3.63">
who likes to focus among other things
</text>
<text start="471.31" dur="3.39">
more on the people side of the equation
</text>
<text start="473.02" dur="3.21">
and so the two of them have their
</text>
<text start="474.7" dur="3.87">
separate spheres but they come together
</text>
<text start="476.23" dur="6.69">
they respect each other and it&#39;s really
</text>
<text start="478.57" dur="7.16">
effective for them now having said this
</text>
<text start="482.92" dur="5.07">I also think it&#39;s important to say</text>
<text start="485.73" dur="5.08">
sometimes when I talk about this people
</text>
<text start="487.99" dur="4.2">
think that because I&#39;m talking about the
</text>
<text start="490.81" dur="3.45">
power of introverts that there&#39;s a kind
</text>
<text start="492.19" dur="4.72">
of implicit down with extroverts and
</text>
<text start="494.26" dur="4.78">
it&#39;s really not that at all so I
</text>
<text start="496.91" dur="3.9">
I want to make that point explicit you
</text>
<text start="499.04" dur="3.93">
know my husband&#39;s an extrovert my
</text>
<text start="500.81" dur="3.63">
beloved husband many of my best friends
</text>
<text start="502.97" dur="3.45">
are extroverts and I love extroverts so
</text>
<text start="504.44" dur="6.84">it&#39;s really about everybody coming</text>
<text start="506.42" dur="9.119">
together and I want to ask you to think
</text>
<text start="511.28" dur="5.34">
also about now finally which one are you
</text>
<text start="515.539" dur="2.791">
and I&#39;m just going to ask you to raise
</text>
<text start="516.62" dur="4.29">
your hand there&#39;s no trick question here
</text>
<text start="518.33" dur="8.01">
are you how many of you would describe
</text>
<text start="520.91" dur="6.72">
yourselves as introverts okay and how
</text>
<text start="526.34" dur="4.74">
many would you describe yourselves as
</text>
<text start="527.63" dur="6.48">
extroverts interesting okay so this
</text>
<text start="531.08" dur="5.85">
crowd I would say it&#39;s probably about 70
</text>
<text start="534.11" dur="8.43">
30 65 35 something like that in favor of
</text>
<text start="536.93" dur="7.56">
extroverts okay now I&#39;m not in using
</text>
<text start="542.54" dur="4.38">these terms wanting to take away from</text>
<text start="544.49" dur="5.22">
anybody&#39;s kind of glorious complexity as
</text>
<text start="546.92" dur="5.25">
human beings we are all a mishmash of
</text>
<text start="549.71" dur="4.35">
both and you know even Carl Jung the
</text>
<text start="552.17" dur="4.47">psychologist who first popularized these</text>
<text start="554.06" dur="4.53">
terms in the 1920s even Carl Jung said
</text>
<text start="556.64" dur="3.81">there is no such thing as a pure</text>
<text start="558.59" dur="3.96">
introvert or pure extrovert that such a
</text>
<text start="560.45" dur="4.17">
man would be in a lunatic asylum if he
</text>
<text start="562.55" dur="3.12">
existed at all so we all know what it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="564.62" dur="4.1">
like to be on the other side of the
</text>
<text start="565.67" dur="5.97">
spectrum and yet I think that many of us
</text>
<text start="568.72" dur="4.45">
do relate to one type or the other and
</text>
<text start="571.64" dur="4.14">
it&#39;s important to know which way we go
</text>
<text start="573.17" dur="5.19">
because these orientations I believe are
</text>
<text start="575.78" dur="4.23">
as profound as gender and they influence
</text>
<text start="578.36" dur="3.45">
how we like to work how we like to
</text>
<text start="580.01" dur="3.39">
connect with people how we like to love
</text>
<text start="581.81" dur="3.36">
they influence everything that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="583.4" dur="4.58">
important about being alive and that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="585.17" dur="6.09">
why it&#39;s important to get it right now
</text>
<text start="587.98" dur="6.31">
what is important there is it&#39;s not even
</text>
<text start="591.26" dur="4.83">
so much who we are it&#39;s really why our
</text>
<text start="594.29" dur="3.36">
way the way we are you know what is it
</text>
<text start="596.09" dur="2.76">
that makes somebody an introvert or an
</text>
<text start="597.65" dur="4.04">
extrovert and what flows from that
</text>
<text start="598.85" dur="6.42">
understanding so let&#39;s just get that
</text>
<text start="601.69" dur="6.4">clear introversion first of all it&#39;s not</text>
<text start="605.27" dur="5.22">
about shyness the the two terms tend to
</text>
<text start="608.09" dur="5.25">get conflated but really shyness is</text>
<text start="610.49" dur="4.44">
about the fear of social judgment you
</text>
<text start="613.34" dur="2.46">
know if you&#39;re a shy person you&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="614.93" dur="4.08">through the world</text>
<text start="615.8" dur="5.22">
I&#39;m ascribing negative judgments of
</text>
<text start="619.01" dur="3.24">
yourself in other people your imagined
</text>
<text start="621.02" dur="4.35">
people are judging you in a harsh way
</text>
<text start="622.25" dur="4.98">and some introverts are indeed shy and</text>
<text start="625.37" dur="2.98">
some are not so there&#39;s some overlap but
</text>
<text start="627.23" dur="3.53">not complete</text>
<text start="628.35" dur="4.63">
introversion and extraversion it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="630.76" dur="7.74">
really about how you respond to
</text>
<text start="632.98" dur="7.86">
stimulation so introverts introverts
</text>
<text start="638.5" dur="4.17">
feel at their most alive and their most
</text>
<text start="640.84" dur="3.99">
energized and their most switched on
</text>
<text start="642.67" dur="3.33">
when they are in quieter environments
</text>
<text start="644.83" dur="2.79">
where there&#39;s kind of looked at there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="646" dur="3.18">
just less stuff coming at them there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="647.62" dur="3.51">less stimulation coming at them and</text>
<text start="649.18" dur="4.71">
extroverts are completely the opposite
</text>
<text start="651.13" dur="4.02">
extroverts crave more stimulation coming
</text>
<text start="653.89" dur="2.7">
at them and if they don&#39;t get enough of
</text>
<text start="655.15" dur="4.74">
it they start to feel bored and restless
</text>
<text start="656.59" dur="5.43">
and unhappy so so it&#39;s really quite a
</text>
<text start="659.89" dur="4.95">
different thing and it&#39;s important to
</text>
<text start="662.02" dur="4.38">
understand it in this way because we
</text>
<text start="664.84" dur="4.65">
still often think of introversion as
</text>
<text start="666.4" dur="4.98">
being about being antisocial or a social
</text>
<text start="669.49" dur="3.99">
in some way or not socially skilled and
</text>
<text start="671.38" dur="3.63">
it&#39;s really not about this
</text>
<text start="673.48" dur="4.08">it&#39;s about being differently social</text>
<text start="675.01" dur="4.26">
because if you are somebody who likes to
</text>
<text start="677.56" dur="3.33">
have less stimulation coming at you you
</text>
<text start="679.27" dur="4.38">
know you&#39;re going to socialize more by
</text>
<text start="680.89" dur="4.26">
having one-on-one a glass of wine with
</text>
<text start="683.65" dur="3.21">
your close friend as opposed to going
</text>
<text start="685.15" dur="3.63">
out to a big thumping party full of
</text>
<text start="686.86" dur="4.62">
strangers and at work you&#39;re going to
</text>
<text start="688.78" dur="4.56">
prefer to solve problems by having a a
</text>
<text start="691.48" dur="3.33">
one-on-one in-depth talk behind the
</text>
<text start="693.34" dur="2.76">
scenes as opposed to going into a
</text>
<text start="694.81" dur="3.6">
meeting and having everything kind of
</text>
<text start="696.1" dur="3.69">
thrown at you and having a big
</text>
<text start="698.41" dur="3.6">
back-and-forth because you know if
</text>
<text start="699.79" dur="4.17">
there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s a highly
</text>
<text start="702.01" dur="3.33">stimulating environment it&#39;s a meeting</text>
<text start="703.96" dur="4.47">
right where you have like eight people
</text>
<text start="705.34" dur="4.41">
around a table and ideas going back and
</text>
<text start="708.43" dur="2.73">
forth and everyone talking at once you
</text>
<text start="709.75" dur="2.91">
have to figure out who&#39;s saying what why
</text>
<text start="711.16" dur="3.3">
there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot going on so
</text>
<text start="712.66" dur="5.7">
introverts often find that to be a very
</text>
<text start="714.46" dur="6.27">
stimulating kind of thing but it&#39;s not
</text>
<text start="718.36" dur="4.8">
only and this is so important it&#39;s not
</text>
<text start="720.73" dur="4.14">
only about how we socialize this
</text>
<text start="723.16" dur="3.42">question of stimulation</text>
<text start="724.87" dur="4.17">
it&#39;s about all different kinds of
</text>
<text start="726.58" dur="4.77">
stimulation like noise and lights and
</text>
<text start="729.04" dur="4.2">
that kind of thing also so this one
</text>
<text start="731.35" dur="4.71">
fascinating study by the psychologist
</text>
<text start="733.24" dur="4.68">
Russell Gein he gave math problems to
</text>
<text start="736.06" dur="3.3">
groups of introverts and extroverts with
</text>
<text start="737.92" dur="2.82">
varying levels of background noise
</text>
<text start="739.36" dur="3.63">
playing while the people were doing the
</text>
<text start="740.74" dur="4.14">
math problems and he found that the
</text>
<text start="742.99" dur="4.77">
introverts did better when the noise
</text>
<text start="744.88" dur="5.25">levels were lower and the extroverts did</text>
<text start="747.76" dur="7.98">
better when the noise levels were higher
</text>
<text start="750.13" dur="7.74">
and that is a profound profound bit of
</text>
<text start="755.74" dur="5.89">
research for those of us who care about
</text>
<text start="757.87" dur="5.71">
how people work and create because what
</text>
<text start="761.63" dur="3.21">
research tells us and there&#39;s a lot of
</text>
<text start="763.58" dur="3.45">other there&#39;s a long line of research</text>
<text start="764.84" dur="5.52">
out there that&#39;s just like it what this
</text>
<text start="767.03" dur="5.25">
research tells us is that we each need
</text>
<text start="770.36" dur="3.69">
very different kinds of environments to
</text>
<text start="772.28" dur="3.3">
function optimally you know in to beat
</text>
<text start="774.05" dur="3.69">
our most energized to be in our most
</text>
<text start="775.58" dur="6.39">
creative and in a position to be
</text>
<text start="777.74" dur="6.72">
innovative and yet and and and this is
</text>
<text start="781.97" dur="4.02">
really the fuel that has led me to write
</text>
<text start="784.46" dur="3.93">
my book and be up here talking to you
</text>
<text start="785.99" dur="4.71">
now you know and yet the world is not
</text>
<text start="788.39" dur="4.23">
designed in a way that accommodates both
</text>
<text start="790.7" dur="4.32">
kinds the world is mostly at our
</text>
<text start="792.62" dur="6.39">
workplaces are mostly designed for

<text start="795.02" dur="7.26">
extroverts we live now in particular
</text>
<text start="799.01" dur="7.32">
with a value system that I call the new
</text>
<text start="802.28" dur="5.91">
groupthink which is which is basically
</text>
<text start="806.33" dur="4.02">
the idea that creativity and
</text>
<text start="808.19" dur="6">
productivity emerges from a very
</text>
<text start="810.35" dur="6.03">
gregarious place and you can see this
</text>
<text start="814.19" dur="3.84">
throughout most of our most important
</text>
<text start="816.38" dur="6.54">
institutions you know our schools and
</text>
<text start="818.03" dur="8.61">
our workplaces so many of us nowadays
</text>
<text start="822.92" dur="5.1">
are working in open-plan offices where
</text>
<text start="826.64" dur="3.27">
there are no walls or there&#39;s very
</text>
<text start="828.02" dur="4.41">
little respite from the noise or the
</text>
<text start="829.91" dur="3.99">
gaze of your coworkers this is a more
</text>
<text start="832.43" dur="5.06">
and more popular way to work across the
</text>
<text start="833.9" dur="6.48">
world and it&#39;s really really distracting
</text>
<text start="837.49" dur="4.57">
you know I actually had the chance to
</text>
<text start="840.38" dur="5.97">
work in one of these offices just a few
</text>
<text start="842.06" dur="7.56">
weeks ago I was camped out in London and
</text>
<text start="846.35" dur="5.19">
borrowed somebody&#39;s office and I mean
</text>
<text start="849.62" dur="3.39">
aside from finding it distracting to
</text>
<text start="851.54" dur="3.3">
just have hit on the clickety clack of
</text>
<text start="853.01" dur="3.81">
everybody&#39;s computer Keys going on all
</text>
<text start="854.84" dur="3.51">
around me I felt like you had to just
</text>
<text start="856.82" dur="4.35">
spend a lot of energy just thinking
</text>
<text start="858.35" dur="3.93">
about how to arrange your face when
</text>
<text start="861.17" dur="3.69">
you&#39;re in an environment like this
</text>
<text start="862.28" dur="4.89">
because you like you&#39;re right out there
</text>
<text start="864.86" dur="3.72">
in the open and for me and I&#39;m guessing
</text>
<text start="867.17" dur="3.42">
I&#39;m not alone in this for me when I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="868.58" dur="3.99">
really focused and you&#39;re really in the

<text start="870.59" dur="4.02">
zone and in a good happy place in my
</text>
<text start="872.57" dur="5.49">
mind with my work I kind of look like
</text>
<text start="874.61" dur="5.94">
this and it looks kind of depressed and
</text>
<text start="878.06" dur="4.02">
you can&#39;t really look that way when
</text>
<text start="880.55" dur="3.36">
you&#39;re out there with your colleagues so
</text>
<text start="882.08" dur="3.75">
it&#39;s already you&#39;re devoting all this
</text>
<text start="883.91" dur="3.45">
energy into self presentation that
</text>
<text start="885.83" dur="4.65">
really could better be applied to other
</text>
<text start="887.36" dur="4.62">
tasks but there&#39;s also there&#39;s actually
</text>
<text start="890.48" dur="3.66">
a mountain of research out there that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="891.98" dur="3.06">
little talked about for reasons I can&#39;t
</text>
<text start="894.14" dur="2.369">fathom it&#39;s all</text>
<text start="895.04" dur="3.299">
my book but there&#39;s a mountain of
</text>
<text start="896.509" dur="3.781">
research out there on the larger
</text>
<text start="898.339" dur="4.201">
problems of open offices you know they
</text>
<text start="900.29" dur="4.46">
make people distracted they make them
</text>
<text start="902.54" dur="5.31">
hostile they make them anxious and
</text>
<text start="904.75" dur="5.23">paradoxically they actually inhibit the</text>
<text start="907.85" dur="3.989">
formation of close friendships because
</text>
<text start="909.98" dur="3.27">
if you think about it you know how do
</text>
<text start="911.839" dur="2.94">
you start a close friendship with
</text>
<text start="913.25" dur="3.36">
someone how do you really establish
</text>
<text start="914.779" dur="4.081">
intimacy you know very often the
</text>
<text start="916.61" dur="4.89">
currency for that is shared confessions
</text>
<text start="918.86" dur="4.469">
shared confidences and you can&#39;t really
</text>
<text start="921.5" dur="3.63">
have shared confidences if you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="923.329" dur="3.421">
working in this kind of an environment
</text>
<text start="925.13" dur="6.29">because everybody can overhear</text>
<text start="926.75" dur="6.66">
everything that you&#39;re saying so I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="931.42" dur="3.909">
opposed to these kinds of offices in
</text>
<text start="933.41" dur="3.419">
general and I believe this is true for
</text>
<text start="935.329" dur="3.421">
extroverts as well as introverts all the
</text>
<text start="936.829" dur="3.541">
problems I&#39;m talking about but it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="938.75" dur="3.529">
worse for introverts it&#39;s worse for
</text>
<text start="940.37" dur="3.899">introverts because of the differences in</text>
<text start="942.279" dur="3.37">
responses to stimulation that I was
</text>
<text start="944.269" dur="3.841">
talking about before if you&#39;re somebody
</text>
<text start="945.649" dur="3.721">
who gets distracted and just feels kind
</text>
<text start="948.11" dur="2.789">of jangled when you have too much coming</text>
<text start="949.37" dur="6.329">
at you then working in this kind of
</text>
<text start="950.899" dur="6.87">
situation can be really problematic same
</text>
<text start="955.699" dur="3.271">
thing though is happening in our schools
</text>
<text start="957.769" dur="3.481">
and you know I was telling you that
</text>
<text start="958.97" dur="4.44">
children nowadays from a very early age
</text>
<text start="961.25" dur="4.23">
are given the message that they really
</text>
<text start="963.41" dur="5.94">
should be more like extroverts so
</text>
<text start="965.48" dur="5.76">
increasingly our our school lessons are
</text>
<text start="969.35" dur="4.65">
taught as group projects like the kind
</text>
<text start="971.24" dur="4.649">
that you&#39;re seeing here and this is true
</text>
<text start="974" dur="3.329">
you know even in subjects like math and
</text>
<text start="975.889" dur="3.93">
creative writing which you would think
</text>
<text start="977.329" dur="4.891">
would depend to some extent on solo
</text>
<text start="979.819" dur="4.171">
flights of thought nowadays students are
</text>
<text start="982.22" dur="3.809">
encouraged to work as committee members
</text>
<text start="983.99" dur="3.45">
and you know at least in the u.s. I
</text>
<text start="986.029" dur="3.24">
don&#39;t know if this is true here in
</text>
<text start="987.44" dur="4.94">
Norway for example but in the u.s. there
</text>
<text start="989.269" dur="5.341">
was a study that found that um
</text>
<text start="992.38" dur="4.48">
majority of teachers believe that the
</text>
<text start="994.61" dur="3.659">
ideal student is an extrovert even
</text>
<text start="996.86" dur="3.089">though by the way introverted kids get</text>
<text start="998.269" dur="3.601">
better grades and they go on throughout
</text>
<text start="999.949" dur="3.901">
university to get better grades to win
</text>
<text start="1001.87" dur="4.079">
more scholarships and they&#39;ve been found
</text>
<text start="1003.85" dur="3.63">
to be more knowledgeable about a wide

<text start="1005.949" dur="2.851">
variety of subject and what&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1007.48" dur="2.729">
interesting about that by the way is
</text>
<text start="1008.8" dur="3.57">
that their IQ is no higher than
</text>
<text start="1010.209" dur="4.23">
extroverts not at all you know there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1012.37" dur="3.959">
no difference between the two but the
</text>
<text start="1014.439" dur="3.801">reason that introverted kids do better</text>
<text start="1016.329" dur="4.051">
sort of any from the academic side is
</text>
<text start="1018.24" dur="4.18">
this quality that we were talking about
</text>
<text start="1020.38" dur="2.98">of being persistent</text>
<text start="1022.42" dur="2.83">you know and</text>
<text start="1023.36" dur="7.89">
sitting and focusing and that actually
</text>
<text start="1025.25" dur="8.88">
has its benefits I want to give you a
</text>
<text start="1031.25" dur="4.709">
sense because this stuff is pretty deep
</text>
<text start="1034.13" dur="3.6">
and pretty visceral so I want to give
</text>
<text start="1035.959" dur="4.081">
you a sense of the way in which as
</text>
<text start="1037.73" dur="4.02">
introverts we absorb the message that
</text>
<text start="1040.04" dur="3.6">
there&#39;s something wrong with our way of
</text>
<text start="1041.75" dur="3.449">
being and it tends to happen you know
</text>
<text start="1043.64" dur="4.049">
from the time you&#39;re a little kid and it
</text>
<text start="1045.199" dur="4.891">
happens in very small moments that
</text>
<text start="1047.689" dur="5.221">
accumulate over time so I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="1050.09" dur="5.64">
tell you a story from my own life this
</text>
<text start="1052.91" dur="7.08">
is a story of the first time I went away
</text>
<text start="1055.73" dur="7.59">
to summer camp and my mother packed for
</text>
<text start="1059.99" dur="5.97">
me a suitcase full of books which to me
</text>
<text start="1063.32" dur="4.979">
was a perfectly natural thing to do
</text>
<text start="1065.96" dur="4.41">
because I grew up in this family where
</text>
<text start="1068.299" dur="5.581">
reading with the primary group activity
</text>
<text start="1070.37" dur="5.939">
and that might sound anti-social to you
</text>
<text start="1073.88" dur="4.41">
but you know in our family it was just
</text>
<text start="1076.309" dur="3.211">
like I said a different way of being

really different camp was more like a

everybody else and I just waited for the

time that I could go off with my books

just curiously why I was being so mellow

came up to me with a concerned

have camp spirit and that was what it

was all about and so I put my books away

in my suitcase and there they stayed for

<text start="1199.26" dur="3.54">
the rest of the summer they were tucked

<text start="1202.8" dur="3.15">
my bed and I felt for the rest of the

<text start="1204.51" dur="3.84">
summer I felt as if the books were
</text>
<text start="1205.95" dur="3.39">
calling to me and I felt guilty I felt

<text start="1208.35" dur="2.55">
like they were calling and I wasn&#39;t
</text>
<text start="1209.34" dur="3.99">
answering and that it was somehow
</text>
<text start="1210.9" dur="3.75">
forsaking them but but I did leave them

<text start="1213.33" dur="3.33">
there and I didn&#39;t open that suitcase

<text start="1214.65" dur="5.31">
again until I was home at the end of the
</text>
<text start="1216.66" dur="5.34">
summer and I tell you this story not
</text>
<text start="1219.96" dur="4.89">
because it was some great trauma in and
</text>
<text start="1222" dur="4.74">
of itself but more because it was one of

<text start="1224.85" dur="3.93">
you know fifty stories that I could tell

<text start="1226.74" dur="3.81">
you about all the times that you get the

<text start="1228.78" dur="4.29">
message as an introvert that there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1230.55" dur="5.04">
something somehow wrong with your more
</text>
<text start="1233.07" dur="4.8">
quiet more reflective way of being and I
</text>
<text start="1235.59" dur="4.38">
always was sensing instinctively that
</text>
<text start="1237.87" dur="7.26">
there was something wrong with this idea
</text>
<text start="1239.97" dur="7.23">
and yet I absorbed it and so I became as
</text>
<text start="1245.13" dur="4.74">
you heard I became a corporate lawyer on
</text>
<text start="1247.2" dur="4.29">
Wall Street for many years even though
</text>
<text start="1249.87" dur="3.84">
you know I had always longed to be a
</text>
<text start="1251.49" dur="3.84">
writer but I became a corporate lawyer
</text>
<text start="1253.71" dur="3.75">
partly because I needed to prove to
</text>
<text start="1255.33" dur="3.99">
myself that I could be very bold and
</text>
<text start="1257.46" dur="3.87">
very assertive the way lawyers I thought
</text>
<text start="1259.32" dur="4.56">
were supposed to be and I was always

<text start="1261.33" dur="3.81">
going off to crowded bars when I would

<text start="1263.88" dur="3.66">
have preferred to have a glass of wine

<text start="1265.14" dur="5.4">
with a close friend and I was making
</text>
<text start="1267.54" dur="5.39">
these choices so reflexively that I
</text>
<text start="1270.54" dur="5.57">
wasn&#39;t even aware that I was making them
</text>
<text start="1272.93" dur="7.16">
now I think that that&#39;s what many inter

shirts do and that it&#39;s our loss but
</text>
<text start="1280.09" dur="5.11">it&#39;s also our colleagues loss and it&#39;s</text>
<text start="1283.49" dur="3.78">our community&#39;s loss and at the risk of</text>
<text start="1285.2" dur="4.74">
sounding grandiose it is the world&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1287.27" dur="5.37">
loss because when it comes to creativity
</text>
<text start="1289.94" dur="3.96">
and to leadership we need introverts
</text>
<text start="1292.64" dur="3.12">
doing what they do best
</text>
<text start="1293.9" dur="6.06">
we need them doing what they do best and
</text>
<text start="1295.76" dur="6.39">
here we come to mistake number two which
</text>
<text start="1299.96" dur="3.9">
I will remind you is that whether you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1302.15" dur="3.48">
an introvert or an extrovert you are
</text>
<text start="1303.86" dur="3.72">
probably spending way too much time in
</text>
<text start="1305.63" dur="4.23">
meetings and not enough time alone and
</text>
<text start="1307.58" dur="4.729">
let me tell you why I say this and what
</text>
<text start="1309.86" dur="6.84">
we can all be learning from introverts
</text>
<text start="1312.309" dur="6.551">when psychologists look at who have been</text>
<text start="1316.7" dur="4.2">
the most spectacularly creative people
</text>
<text start="1318.86" dur="4.74">
over time and across many different
</text>
<text start="1320.9" dur="6.149">
fields they almost always find this they
</text>
<text start="1323.6" dur="6.66">
almost always find people with serious
</text>
<text start="1327.049" dur="5.311">
streaks of introversion in them now
</text>
<text start="1330.26" dur="4.32">
these people are usually extroverted
</text>
<text start="1332.36" dur="4.41">
enough that they go out happily and
</text>
<text start="1334.58" dur="3.9">
exchange ideas and advance ideas because
</text>
<text start="1336.77" dur="3.42">
of course that&#39;s an important part of
</text>
<text start="1338.48" dur="3.06">
creativity too right like it doesn&#39;t
</text>
<text start="1340.19" dur="3.09">
really work to just sit in your
</text>
<text start="1341.54" dur="3.66">
hermetically sealed container and not
</text>
<text start="1343.28" dur="3.57">
actually ever share your ideas so that
</text>
<text start="1345.2" dur="3.66">
of course is an important part of it and
</text>
<text start="1346.85" dur="4.92">
you need to be out there you know
</text>
<text start="1348.86" dur="4.439">
talking to people to to get ideas and to
</text>
<text start="1351.77" dur="4.92">
be having these chance encounters that
</text>
<text start="1353.299" dur="7.141">
make them flourish but you also need
</text>
<text start="1356.69" dur="5.85">
solitude you need it and introverts tend
</text>
<text start="1360.44" dur="3.72">
to be really good at solitude it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1362.54" dur="3.57">something that they crave and this is</text>
<text start="1364.16" dur="3.48">
this the sole thing that gives them the
</text>
<text start="1366.11" dur="4.559">
advantage that they have when it comes
</text>
<text start="1367.64" dur="5.01">
to creativity because introverts will
</text>
<text start="1370.669" dur="3.781">
find ways to get the solitude even if
</text>
<text start="1372.65" dur="4.19">
it&#39;s not handed to them so I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="1374.45" dur="5.7">
give you a couple of examples of this
</text>
<text start="1376.84" dur="6.339">
the guy with a long woolly beard is
</text>
<text start="1380.15" dur="5.1">
Charles Darwin so he was always going

off and taking long walks alone in the

<text start="1385.25" dur="4.26">
woods and turning down dinner party
</text>
<text start="1387.02" dur="4.32">invitations he preferred the company of</text>

his wife and his children in the

countryside and his woodlands the guy in

the middle is Theodor Geisel otherwise

<text start="1396.83" dur="5.339">
known as dr. Seuss so dr. Seuss he

<text start="1400.4" dur="3.12">
created characters like The Cat in the

<text start="1402.169" dur="3.811">
Hat and all these beloved characters
</text>
<text start="1403.52" dur="4.74">
that we know so well he created them in

<text start="1405.98" dur="2.78">
a lonely belltower office that he had in
</text>
<text start="1408.26" dur="3.71">
the back of

house in La Jolla California and he was

a reserved guy so much so that he was

<text start="1415.27" dur="5.37">
actually afraid to meet the children who
</text>
<text start="1418.18" dur="4.05">loved his stories so much for fear that</text>
<text start="1420.64" dur="4.23">
they were expecting him to be this kind

<text start="1422.23" dur="4.7">
of jolly Santa Claus type of guy I would

<text start="1424.87" dur="4.74">
be disappointed with his true self and

then the guy on the right with a more

invented the first Apple Computer so he
</text>
<text start="1437.02" dur="4.62">
did that also mostly alone

<text start="1439.12" dur="5.46">
inspired by others but the actual work
</text>
<text start="1441.64" dur="4.74">
process was sitting alone in his cubicle

<text start="1444.58" dur="3.75">
at Hewlett Packard where he was working

<text start="1446.38" dur="3.81">
at the time he would go in there early

in the morning before work and late at

night after everyone had gone home and

solitary sunrises and Midnight&#39;s as one

NOT saying that collaboration is not

<text start="1463.15" dur="5.1">
important not saying that at all and

<text start="1464.92" dur="4.8">
case in point is Steve Wozniak who

famously came together with Steve Jobs

collaboration between those two but I am

you to imagine for a minute

what if somebody came to you at your

<text start="1549.929" dur="3.63">
for a job or they were asking you for a

promotion and they started talking to

you about how they really don&#39;t like

they really do most of their best work

<text start="1558.479" dur="6.99">
going off on their own would you hire

<text start="1562.709" dur="4.67">
that person would you think of them as a

I&#39;m guessing that for many of you the

happening it turns out we can&#39;t even be

in a group of people you can&#39;t be in a

<text start="1620.879" dur="4.95">
group of people without instinctively

seemingly really personal and visceral

stuff like who you&#39;re attracted to

<text start="1629.489" dur="3.06">
you will start picking up on the

opinions of the people around you and

the crazy thing is you won&#39;t even know

<text start="1634.529" dur="4.68">
you&#39;re doing it you&#39;ll have no idea

<text start="1636.57" dur="3.959">
you&#39;ll think that this is what you think

another thing that goes wrong in groups

<text start="1653.099" dur="8.07">
is it&#39;s actually really hard to dissent

<text start="1658.95" dur="3.87">
from group opinion regardless of how

going to ask you to come with me in your

research for my book and the year that I

<text start="1725.94" dur="5.55">
was at HBS well really every year at HBS
</text>
<text start="1729.69" dur="3.09">
the first year students participate in

<text start="1731.49" dur="4.11">
this exercise that&#39;s called the
</text>
<text start="1732.78" dur="6.3">
subarctic survival exercise the way it
</text>
<text start="1735.6" dur="4.77">
works is that groups of students are put
</text>
<text start="1739.08" dur="3.3">
together and they&#39;re doing this roleplay
</text>
<text start="1740.37" dur="4.44">
where they have to pretend that they

<text start="1742.38" dur="4.26">
were just crash landed their plane in

the subarctic and they have managed to

salvage from the plane sixteen items

that they now have to rank in order of

</text>
<text start="1753.33" dur="3.87">
the game works is that first you have to
</text>
<text start="1755.07" dur="4.89">
each person each individual has to rank
</text>
<text start="1757.2" dur="4.74">
these items on their own and then you
</text>
<text start="1759.96" dur="3.54">
need to come together in a group and as
</text>
<text start="1761.94" dur="3.9">a group figure out what the best ranking</text>
<text start="1763.5" dur="5.19">
is and the idea of the exercise is that
</text>
<text start="1765.84" dur="6">
if a group is functioning well it should
</text>
<text start="1768.69" dur="5.04">
have a synergy to it and the group

should do better than any of the single

<text start="1780.45" dur="4.77">
I was at HBS there was a group that

<text start="1782.85" dur="6.03">
happened to have as one of its members
</text>
<text start="1785.22" dur="5.13">
an Arctic backpacker and so they were
</text>
<text start="1788.88" dur="6.17">
really lucky to have this guy in their
</text>
<text start="1790.35" dur="7.35">
midst but he was also a quieter type and
</text>
<text start="1795.05" dur="4.09">
so every time he advanced his ideas
</text>
<text start="1797.7" dur="3.21">
about what they should be doing and how
</text>
<text start="1799.14" dur="2.979">
to be ranking the items the group
</text>
<text start="1800.91" dur="3.339">listened politely</text>
<text start="1802.119" dur="4.74">
moved on to the opinions of the more
</text>
<text start="1804.249" dur="4.56">
assertive members of the group and as a
</text>
<text start="1806.859" dur="5.1">result their scores were really quite</text>
<text start="1808.809" dur="4.65">
low and some of them said and they had
</text>
<text start="1811.959" dur="3.3">
the chance when they were done to watch
</text>
<text start="1813.459" dur="3.15">
a video playback of what their process
</text>
<text start="1815.259" dur="3.12">
had been and some of them were really
</text>
<text start="1816.609" dur="3.84">
embarrassed to watch themselves you know
</text>
<text start="1818.379" dur="3.93">
just ignoring the person who was saying
</text>
<text start="1820.449" dur="3.63">
the right thing and going off in the
</text>
<text start="1822.309" dur="5">
wrong direction and just kind of blindly
</text>
<text start="1824.079" dur="5.43">
following in some kind of visceral way
</text>
<text start="1827.309" dur="5.77">
the ideas of the most confident person
</text>
<text start="1829.509" dur="5.52">
but they didn&#39;t really need to have felt
</text>
<text start="1833.079" dur="3.81">
so embarrassed because of course this is
</text>
<text start="1835.029" dur="4.5">
something we all do this is a trap that
</text>
<text start="1836.889" dur="6.24">
we fall into it&#39;s been repeated in
</text>
<text start="1839.529" dur="7.29">
studies again and again and so what I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="1843.129" dur="6.12">
saying to you is that we need to be
</text>
<text start="1846.819" dur="5.28">
freed of the distortions of group
</text>
<text start="1849.249" dur="4.74">
dynamics if we can ever hope to really
</text>
<text start="1852.099" dur="3.78">
know what is happening deep inside our
</text>
<text start="1853.989" dur="3.39">
own minds and if we can really to get
</text>
<text start="1855.879" dur="6.24">
the best of what&#39;s going on in our own
</text>
<text start="1857.379" dur="6.81">
minds now this case that I&#39;m making to
</text>
<text start="1862.119" dur="5.04">you there&#39;s a lot of psychological</text>
<text start="1864.189" dur="5.1">
research out there to bolster it and
</text>
<text start="1867.159" dur="4.59">
I&#39;ve just given you a few studies just
</text>
<text start="1869.289" dur="3.93">
as examples but the truth is that
</text>
<text start="1871.749" dur="3.66">
everything I&#39;m saying to you is
</text>
<text start="1873.219" dur="5.52">
something that we&#39;ve kind of all known
</text>
<text start="1875.409" dur="5.81">
instinctively for centuries it&#39;s only
</text>
<text start="1878.739" dur="5.04">
recently that we have begun to forget it
</text>
<text start="1881.219" dur="4.54">
we&#39;ve known it for centuries if you look
</text>
<text start="1883.779" dur="4.92">
at all of the world&#39;s major religions
</text>
<text start="1885.759" dur="5.46">
all of them all of them tell stories of
</text>
<text start="1888.699" dur="4.89">
seekers you know Moses Jesus Buddha
</text>
<text start="1891.219" dur="5.91">
Muhammad the seekers who would go off by
</text>
<text start="1893.589" dur="5.46">
themselves to the wilderness where they
</text>
<text start="1897.129" dur="3.15">
would have great revelations they were
</text>
<text start="1899.049" dur="3.15">
always by themselves when the
</text>
<text start="1900.279" dur="3.84">
revelations came you know up on up on
</text>
<text start="1902.199" dur="3.78">
Mount Sinai and then they would come
</text>
<text start="1904.119" dur="3.72">
down from their lonely mountain tops and
</text>
<text start="1905.979" dur="3.78">then they would share the revolution the</text>
<text start="1907.839" dur="4.35">
revelations with their respective
</text>
<text start="1909.759" dur="6.32">
communities so that is how it works is
</text>
<text start="1912.189" dur="3.89">
like no wilderness no revelation
</text>
<text start="1919.64" dur="6.039">
so these are broad ideas but I&#39;d like to
</text>
<text start="1922.35" dur="5.699">
leave you with five and more concrete
</text>
<text start="1925.679" dur="4.561">
ideas for change and what how you can be
</text>
<text start="1928.049" dur="4.411">
applying this in your own lives and the
</text>
<text start="1930.24" dur="4.439">
first suggestion I&#39;m going to give you
</text>
<text start="1932.46" dur="4.439">
is to really think about how to design
</text>
<text start="1934.679" dur="4.801">
your office spaces and to design them
</text>
<text start="1936.899" dur="4.171">
mindfully so that the introverts and the
</text>
<text start="1939.48" dur="3.63">extroverts can both be operating in the</text>
<text start="1941.07" dur="4.199">
stimulation level that they need
</text>
<text start="1943.11" dur="4.53">
okay now Steve Jobs when he designed
</text>
<text start="1945.269" dur="7.081">
Pixar this has been much written about
</text>
<text start="1947.64" dur="6.3">
he he he created this gigantic open
</text>
<text start="1952.35" dur="3.39">
atrium that you had to pass through
</text>
<text start="1953.94" dur="3.599">
anytime you needed to use the restroom
</text>
<text start="1955.74" dur="3.21">
and the idea of this was to encourage
</text>
<text start="1957.539" dur="3.301">
people to have the kind of chance
</text>
<text start="1958.95" dur="4.349">encounters that foster creative</text>
<text start="1960.84" dur="4.949">
breakthroughs and I think this is a
</text>
<text start="1963.299" dur="4.281">
great idea you may have expected me to
</text>
<text start="1965.789" dur="4.401">
say terrible I think it&#39;s a great idea
</text>
<text start="1967.58" dur="4.42">these casual chance encounters are</text>
<text start="1970.19" dur="3.489">
wonderful they&#39;re much better than the
</text>
<text start="1972" dur="3.69">
formal kind you know it formally sitting
</text>
<text start="1973.679" dur="3.71">
together in a meeting and they&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1975.69" dur="4.92">
important they&#39;re absolutely important
</text>
<text start="1977.389" dur="5.861">
but we also need an addition to that
</text>
<text start="1980.61" dur="5.01">
private spaces giving people more
</text>
<text start="1983.25" dur="4.38">
autonomy more solitude more privacy and
</text>
<text start="1985.62" dur="3.87">
I recently visited Google&#39;s headquarters
</text>
<text start="1987.63" dur="3.33">
in New York and they do some of this
</text>
<text start="1989.49" dur="2.97">
really beautifully you know there are
</text>
<text start="1990.96" dur="3.87">these gigantic cafe areas where</text>
<text start="1992.46" dur="3.929">
everybody is coming together and you can
</text>
<text start="1994.83" dur="3.54">
go there all day long but they&#39;ve also
</text>
<text start="1996.389" dur="4.321">
got a lovely library where people
</text>
<text start="1998.37" dur="3.87">
actually go there quiet looks and
</text>
<text start="2000.71" dur="3.089">
crannies all over the place where people
</text>
<text start="2002.24" dur="4.049">
can take their laptops and go and work
</text>
<text start="2003.799" dur="3.901">
there even alternative cafes that are
</text>
<text start="2006.289" dur="3.6">
quieter and more out-of-the-way where
</text>
<text start="2007.7" dur="6.27">people can also go and the important</text>
<text start="2009.889" dur="6.721">
thing is that the way it&#39;s set up it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2013.97" dur="4.799">
it&#39;s very obvious that these spaces are
</text>
<text start="2016.61" dur="4.59">
weighted equally you know what there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2018.769" dur="5.581">
not an idea that the person who&#39;s going
</text>
<text start="2021.2" dur="4.68">
off is somehow violating some code of
</text>
<text start="2024.35" dur="2.97">
social responsibility to the company
</text>
<text start="2025.88" dur="3.08">
which is the way many people feel at
</text>
<text start="2027.32" dur="3.839">
work you know many companies where
</text>
<text start="2028.96" dur="3.819">
excuse me where people are lucky enough
</text>
<text start="2031.159" dur="3.15">
still to have their own private offices
</text>
<text start="2032.779" dur="3.12">
there&#39;s still an idea that you&#39;re not
</text>
<text start="2034.309" dur="4.441">
even supposed to close your door because
</text>
<text start="2035.899" dur="4.861">
somehow that is a barrier to
</text>
<text start="2038.75" dur="3.57">
communication when in fact it might just
</text>
<text start="2040.76" dur="3.57">
be somebody wanting to get their work
</text>
<text start="2042.32" dur="4.29">
done for the sake of that greater
</text>
<text start="2044.33" dur="5.87">
community of the company so I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="2046.61" dur="5.13">
advocating balance in in office design
</text>
<text start="2050.2" dur="4.22">second</text>
<text start="2051.74" dur="4.83">
idea is to run meetings very
</text>
<text start="2054.42" dur="4.56">
thoughtfully and what I mean by this is
</text>
<text start="2056.57" dur="4.5">
introverts and extroverts in meetings
</text>
<text start="2058.98" dur="5.46">
tend to have a great miscommunication
</text>
<text start="2061.07" dur="5.14">
the introverts often feel as if the
</text>
<text start="2064.44" dur="3.66">
meeting is kind of happening so quickly
</text>
<text start="2066.21" dur="4.17">
but by the time they think of the thing
</text>
<text start="2068.1" dur="6.03">
that they had wanted to say the meetings
</text>
<text start="2070.38" dur="5.64">
over and extroverts will often report
</text>
<text start="2074.13" dur="3.27">feeling maddened by the introverts in</text>
<text start="2076.02" dur="3.15">
their midst because they&#39;ll say you I
</text>
<text start="2077.4" dur="3.42">
know that this person has so many great
</text>
<text start="2079.17" dur="3.09">
ideas so why on earth won&#39;t they just
</text>
<text start="2080.82" dur="2.76">
say so in the meeting like why are they
</text>
<text start="2082.26" dur="2.94">
holding back it can be really
</text>
<text start="2083.58" dur="4.05">
frustrating you know it&#39;s very
</text>
<text start="2085.2" dur="3.93">
understandable so what is the way around
</text>
<text start="2087.63" dur="3.21">
this when you&#39;re having meetings okay
</text>
<text start="2089.13" dur="5.12">
I&#39;m going to give you three ideas number
</text>
<text start="2090.84" dur="5.88">
one distribute agendas in advance and
</text>
<text start="2094.25" dur="3.97">
really make it an obligation of coming
</text>
<text start="2096.72" dur="2.91">
to the meeting that you actually read
</text>
<text start="2098.22" dur="3.18">
the agenda and not just read it but
</text>
<text start="2099.63" dur="3">
prepare for the meeting based on it and
</text>
<text start="2101.4" dur="2.61">
maybe even start the meeting having
</text>
<text start="2102.63" dur="4.32">everybody talk about what their thoughts</text>
<text start="2104.01" dur="5.01">
are based on the agenda because that is
</text>
<text start="2106.95" dur="4.17">
a way of giving introverts the time that
</text>
<text start="2109.02" dur="3.6">
they need to kind of really think think
</text>
<text start="2111.12" dur="3.36">
things through and process before
</text>
<text start="2112.62" dur="3.99">
sharing ideas we by definition
</text>

introverts think before they speak and
</text>
<text start="2116.61" dur="4.05">extroverts think as they speak so there</text>
<text start="2118.68" dur="4.02">
needs to be a way in meetings to address
</text>
<text start="2120.66" dur="5.01">that divide okay</text>
<text start="2122.7" dur="4.53">
second idea for addressing it is to have
</text>
<text start="2125.67" dur="4.92">
a time during the meeting where you kind
</text>
<text start="2127.23" dur="4.59">
of stop everything and say okay
</text>
<text start="2130.59" dur="3.21">
everybody&#39;s going to write down their
</text>
<text start="2131.82" dur="3.78">
ideas right now like just sit for a
</text>
<text start="2133.8" dur="3.75">
minute take two minutes write down what
</text>
<text start="2135.6" dur="3.45">
you&#39;re thinking and then maybe go around
</text>
<text start="2137.55" dur="3.42">
the room and have everybody read it and
</text>
<text start="2139.05" dur="3.18">
that&#39;s a way of getting the people who
</text>
<text start="2140.97" dur="2.79">
might have been reluctant to interject
</text>
<text start="2142.23" dur="3.96">
or who just need the extra time to
</text>
<text start="2143.76" dur="5.67">
process to actually get their ideas out
</text>
<text start="2146.19" dur="6.84">
there and then the third idea is to look
</text>
<text start="2149.43" dur="5.82">
for ways also to meet electronically to
</text>
<text start="2153.03" dur="4.04">
meet online because you know there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2155.25" dur="5.28">
actually 40 years of research out there

<text start="2157.07" dur="4.93">
on brainstorming that has found that

<text start="2160.53" dur="2.99">
brainstorming like groups coming
</text>
<text start="2162" dur="4.35">
together to brainstorm an idea is
</text>
<text start="2163.52" dur="5.41">
actually a disaster and that individuals
</text>
<text start="2166.35" dur="4.74">
almost always almost always produce more
</text>
<text start="2168.93" dur="5.46">
ideas and better ideas than groups
</text>
<text start="2171.09" dur="4.44">
working as a team to brainstorm and I
</text>
<text start="2174.39" dur="3.96">
know this seems surprising because
</text>
<text start="2175.53" dur="5.55">brainstorming is so popular in the</text>

words businesses must be insane to

<text start="2189.28" dur="4.319">
continue using these groups now they&#39;re
</text>
<text start="2191.89" dur="3.56">
not totally insane because actually
</text>
<text start="2193.599" dur="4.561">
these groups do have a benefit which is
</text>
<text start="2195.45" dur="4.84">
they foster trust they faster a cohesion
</text>
<text start="2198.16" dur="3.78">
they build morale they do all kinds of

<text start="2200.29" dur="4.289">
useful things but what they don&#39;t do
</text>
<text start="2201.94" dur="5.99">
that well is get people actually
</text>
<text start="2204.579" dur="5.821">
thinking but the one exception to this
</text>
<text start="2207.93" dur="4.33">
the one exception is electronic
</text>
<text start="2210.4" dur="3.3">brainstorming where the studies are</text>
<text start="2212.26" dur="3.9">
showing that when people are
</text>
<text start="2213.7" dur="4.169">
brainstorming online you know many of
</text>
<text start="2216.16" dur="3.09">
the barriers to effective communication
</text>
<text start="2217.869" dur="5.761">that happen in face-to-face</text>
<text start="2219.25" dur="6.45">
communications dissolve and so electro
</text>
<text start="2223.63" dur="4.86">so online brainstorm errs actually often</text>
<text start="2225.7" dur="8.28">do better than even individuals would so</text>
<text start="2228.49" dur="7.859">
I would suggest that to you okay third
</text>
<text start="2233.98" dur="6.09">
idea is to think really differently
</text>
<text start="2236.349" dur="6.931">
about leadership and to understand that
</text>
<text start="2240.07" dur="6.99">
leadership is really about more than

<text start="2243.28" dur="6.12">
charisma so there&#39;s groundbreaking new

research by Adam grant at the Wharton

deliver better outcomes than extroverts

<text start="2255.28" dur="4.77">
do in certain circumstances the

rousing and inspiration and charisma and

that kind of thing to be getting them

<text start="2266.26" dur="4.29">
going but the introverted leaders
</text>
<text start="2267.819" dur="4.77">
professor grant found did better when
</text>
<text start="2270.55" dur="4.049">
they were managing proactive employees

<text start="2272.589" dur="4.311">
so employees who are kind of full of

ideas and ready to go and and you know
</text>
<text start="2276.9" dur="3.4">
wanting to implement what they had done
</text>
<text start="2278.8" dur="4.17">
the introverted leaders did better
</text>
<text start="2280.3" dur="4.08">
because they were more likely to let
</text>
<text start="2282.97" dur="3.24">
other people run with their ideas

<text start="2284.38" dur="5.1">
whereas extroverts can fall into the

<text start="2286.21" dur="5.52">
trap sometimes of of getting so excited

<text start="2289.48" dur="3.72">
about their own stuff and that they&#39;re

have the ability to to rise to the fore

<text start="2297.869" dur="8.95">
now my favorite example of a quiet

unassuming leader who was incredibly

Adam grant is talking about was a guy

and William McKnight famously had this

<text start="2322.72" dur="9.03">
mantra that was this hire good people
</text>
<text start="2326.8" dur="6.66">
and leave them alone and that is what he
</text>
<text start="2331.75" dur="4.62">
did and he actually really put his money

<text start="2333.46" dur="6.12">
where his mouth was because he gave his

noodle around on any project they felt

like and out of this emerged actually

those yellow post-its that were also

through this philosophy of hire good

philosophy of course that Google still

often 20% of their time to work on their

leadership that I found in my book I

<text start="2368.49" dur="3.52">
looked at some of the most

<text start="2370.18" dur="5.87">
transformative leaders of the 20th
</text>
<text start="2372.01" dur="7.37">
century and I found that a lot of them
</text>
<text start="2376.05" dur="6.31">
ascended to their leadership positions
</text>
<text start="2379.38" dur="5.82">
almost in spite of who they were and I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="2382.36" dur="4.92">
talking here about Eleanor Roosevelt
</text>
<text start="2385.2" dur="5.83">Gandhi and Rosa Parks</text>
<text start="2387.28" dur="6.9">
all of these people described themselves
</text>
<text start="2391.03" dur="6.66">
as being quiet and soft-spoken and even
</text>
<text start="2394.18" dur="6.6">shy and all of them took the spotlight</text>
<text start="2397.69" dur="5.64">
even though every bone in their bodies
</text>
<text start="2400.78" dur="4.38">
was telling them not to and that turned

<text start="2403.33" dur="3.84">
out to have a special power all of its

<text start="2405.16" dur="3.99">
own because people could feel that they
</text>
<text start="2407.17" dur="4.26">
were there not because they enjoyed

being looked at and not because they

enjoy controlling other people they were

they were there because they had no

authenticity that people connect to and

people get and I bet if you think about

<text start="2422.74" dur="3.24">
your own organizations you can think of
</text>
<text start="2424.27" dur="3.39">
people like this who have ascended to
</text>
<text start="2425.98" dur="3.39">
leadership positions because they&#39;re
</text>
<text start="2427.66" dur="2.88">
just really engaged with the company or

they&#39;re engaged with their product line

<text start="2430.54" dur="4.14">
or whatever it is and it&#39;s through that
</text>
<text start="2432.16" dur="4.23">
engagement that they come up through the
</text>
<text start="2434.68" dur="3.42">
leadership ranks and not through
</text>
<text start="2436.39" dur="3.78">
something that&#39;s kind of a more obvious
</text>
<text start="2438.1" dur="3.6">leadership skill but it&#39;s important for</text>
<text start="2440.17" dur="3.93">
us to see things this way and to
</text>
<text start="2441.7" dur="4.08">
understand it this way because we know
</text>
<text start="2444.1" dur="3.6">
from the management research that
</text>
<text start="2445.78" dur="3.66">
introverts tend to be passed over for

leadership positions or they&#39;re not

so you know you might have somebody

<text start="2452.259" dur="4.381">
who&#39;s substantively like really
</text>
<text start="2453.789" dur="4.71">
effective but doesn&#39;t seem like what our

<text start="2456.64" dur="3.299">
idea is our classical idea of a good
</text>
<text start="2458.499" dur="3.06">
leader and so they&#39;re overlooked and
</text>
<text start="2459.939" dur="5.941">
maybe they shouldn&#39;t be maybe they
</text>
<text start="2461.559" dur="5.91">
shouldn&#39;t be okay number four think

promoting I was just talking the other

day with the with a head of a major

<text start="2472.769" dur="5.83">
fashion design company and this woman

<text start="2476.049" dur="5.101">
was telling me that she just realized to

her horror that her deputies had been

</text>
<text start="2486.509" dur="3.82">best presenters not the best designers</text>
<text start="2488.65" dur="2.73">
and so she ended up having to spend a

lot of time and a lot of political
</text>
<text start="2491.38" dur="3.859">
capital undoing these appointments

because she she felt like she couldn&#39;t

take the risk you know of having the

<text start="2497.65" dur="3">
wrong people out there designing the

<text start="2498.939" dur="3.3">
clothes or being in charge of it so I
</text>
<text start="2500.65" dur="2.879">
would just say to you save yourself that
</text>
<text start="2502.239" dur="3.75">
trouble and think about what criteria
</text>
<text start="2503.529" dur="5.52">
are you really using and are you being

<text start="2505.989" dur="4.11">
be dazzled by presentation skills when
</text>
<text start="2509.049" dur="3.3">
there are other skills that matter

equally not saying presentation skills
</text>
<text start="2512.349" dur="3.24">
don&#39;t matter not saying social skills

<text start="2514.119" dur="3.42">
don&#39;t matter obviously all this stuff

<text start="2515.589" dur="4.08">
matters I&#39;m just saying other stuff

<text start="2517.539" dur="6.21">
matters too other stuff matters too and

<text start="2519.669" dur="7.2">
we tend to devalue the other stuff okay

number five and ask you to think about

<text start="2526.869" dur="7.95">
what&#39;s inside your own suitcase so I
</text>
<text start="2532.9" dur="4.23">
told you a story I told you my story

<text start="2534.819" dur="5.13">
about camp when I went off to camp with

<text start="2537.13" dur="5.339">
a suitcase full of books you know I
</text>
<text start="2539.949" dur="4.38">
believe that the the things that we

<text start="2542.469" dur="4.08">
carry around in our suitcase is
</text>
<text start="2544.329" dur="4.2">
metaphorical or real the things that we
</text>
<text start="2546.549" dur="3.39">
stubbornly carry around the things that

<text start="2548.529" dur="3.69">
we carried as children or the things

that we&#39;re still carrying today those
</text>
<text start="2552.219" dur="4.29">
are the things that we really really

<text start="2554.14" dur="4.889">
care about they&#39;re the things that drive
</text>
<text start="2556.509" dur="4.32">
us so you know for me I still have a
</text>
<text start="2559.029" dur="3.99">
suitcase full of books everywhere I go
</text>
<text start="2560.829" dur="3.96">
I&#39;m a reader and I&#39;m a writer and that

<text start="2563.019" dur="4.111">
is what guides what I put into the world

and I&#39;m at my best when I am following
</text>
<text start="2567.13" dur="4.529">
that guidance so I want to ask you to
</text>
<text start="2569.709" dur="4.2">
think about like what really is in your
</text>
<text start="2571.659" dur="4.83">
own suitcase and extroverts maybe your
</text>
<text start="2573.909" dur="4.65">
suitcases are also full of books or
</text>
<text start="2576.489" dur="5.19">
maybe they&#39;re full of champagne glasses

<text start="2578.559" dur="5.13">
or skydiving equipment I mean whatever
</text>
<text start="2581.679" dur="2.941">
they are I hope that you will take these
</text>
<text start="2583.689" dur="3.031">things out every</text>
<text start="2584.62" dur="8.58">
you get and grace us with your energy

<text start="2586.72" dur="11.37">
and with your joy but now introverts you
</text>
<text start="2593.2" dur="7.53">
being you you probably have the impulse
</text>
<text start="2598.09" dur="5.97">
to guard very carefully what&#39;s inside
</text>
<text start="2600.73" dur="5.63">
your own suitcase probably guard it and
</text>
<text start="2604.06" dur="4.88">
don&#39;t show it that often and that&#39;s okay
</text>
<text start="2606.36" dur="6.61">
but I want to invite you just
</text>
<text start="2608.94" dur="5.77">
occasionally to take those things out of
</text>
<text start="2612.97" dur="3.87">
your suitcase and to show them to the
</text>
<text start="2614.71" dur="6.54">
world because the world needs you and it
</text>
<text start="2616.84" dur="6.27">
needs the things that you carry so I
</text>
<text start="2621.25" dur="3.78">
want to leave you with one final story
</text>
<text start="2623.11" dur="3.57">
about this and it&#39;s a personal story

<text start="2625.03" dur="5.6">
about how I came to this realization

<text start="2626.68" dur="3.95">
it&#39;s really a story about my grandfather

my grandfather was a rabbi and he lived

alone in a small Brooklyn apartment he

was a widower he lived alone and this
</text>
<text start="2640.27" dur="3.6">
apartment when I was growing up it was
</text>
<text start="2642.01" dur="2.94">
my favorite place in the world partly
</text>
<text start="2643.87" dur="3.9">
because it was filled with his presence
</text>
<text start="2644.95" dur="5.43">
which was very gentle and very courtly
</text>
<text start="2647.77" dur="5.97">
and lovely and partly because it was
</text>
<text start="2650.38" dur="5.76">
filled with books I mean like literally

apartment had yielded its original
</text>
<text start="2657.88" dur="4.74">
function to just be a surface through
</text>
<text start="2659.95" dur="4.08">
these towering stacks of books you know
</text>
<text start="2662.62" dur="2.79">
just like everybody my family my
</text>
<text start="2664.03" dur="5.1">
grandfather&#39;s favorite thing to do in
</text>
<text start="2665.41" dur="6.09">
the world was to read but my grandfather
</text>
<text start="2669.13" dur="4.59">
also really loved his congregation and
</text>
<text start="2671.5" dur="4.35">
you could feel this love every week in
</text>
<text start="2673.72" dur="3.96">
the sermons that he gave for the 62
</text>
<text start="2675.85" dur="3.27">years that he served as a rabbi he would</text>
<text start="2677.68" dur="3.3">
give these fantastic sermons that were
</text>
<text start="2679.12" dur="3.72">
basically the fruits of each week&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2680.98" dur="3.93">
reading he would pull together these
</text>
<text start="2682.84" dur="4.41">
fantastic tapestries of ancient and
</text>
<text start="2684.91" dur="3.9">
humanist thought and deliver them to his
</text>
<text start="2687.25" dur="2.82">
congregation and people would come from
</text>
<text start="2688.81" dur="3.72">
all over to hear him speak
</text>
<text start="2690.07" dur="4.65">
but the thing is that underneath this
</text>
<text start="2692.53" dur="5.13">
ceremonial role he was a very
</text>
<text start="2694.72" dur="4.53">
introverted person and so when he gave
</text>
<text start="2697.66" dur="4.35">
these sermons he actually had trouble
</text>
<text start="2699.25" dur="4.08">
making eye contact with the people in
</text>
<text start="2702.01" dur="2.64">
the audience you know the same people
</text>
<text start="2703.33" dur="2.91">
into whose eyes he would have been
</text>
<text start="2704.65" dur="3.18">looking for 62 years</text>
<text start="2706.24" dur="4.83">he&#39;d trouble making eye contact with</text>
<text start="2707.83" dur="5.49">
them and even away from the from the
</text>
<text start="2711.07" dur="4.95">
podium if you called him on the phone he
</text>
<text start="2713.32" dur="4.83">
would often hang up prematurely ring off
</text>
<text start="2716.02" dur="2.82">
prematurely because he was afraid that
</text>
<text start="2718.15" dur="4.2">he was taking up</text>
<text start="2718.84" dur="6.77">
too much of your time but when my
</text>
<text start="2722.35" dur="5.61">
grandfather died at the age of 94 the
</text>
<text start="2725.61" dur="4.12">
police had to close down the streets of
</text>
<text start="2727.96" dur="4.17">
his neighborhood to accommodate the
</text>
<text start="2729.73" dur="3.6">throngs of mourners who came because all</text>
<text start="2732.13" dur="5.46">
these people felt like they would never
</text>
<text start="2733.33" dur="7.2">hear those kinds of sermons again and so</text>
<text start="2737.59" dur="8.37">
these days I try personally to learn
</text>
<text start="2740.53" dur="6.96">from my grandfather&#39;s example and I&#39;ve</text>
<text start="2745.96" dur="4.59">
recently written this book it&#39;s about
</text>
<text start="2747.49" dur="4.17">
the power of introverts and I worked on
</text>
<text start="2750.55" dur="4.26">it for seven years</text>
<text start="2751.66" dur="6.06">
like literally from 2005 to 2012 the
</text>
<text start="2754.81" dur="4.44">
book just came out in January and so for
</text>
<text start="2757.72" dur="3.06">
me those seven years of working on this
</text>
<text start="2759.25" dur="3.33">
book were total bliss you know it was
</text>
<text start="2760.78" dur="4.17">
like my version of my grandfather&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2762.58" dur="3.78">
hours alone in his library because I was
</text>
<text start="2764.95" dur="3.81">
reading I was writing I was thinking I
</text>
<text start="2766.36" dur="4.14">
was researching was all good but then
</text>
<text start="2768.76" dur="3.57">
came the time this past January where I
</text>
<text start="2770.5" dur="3.3">
had to go out and actually promote the
</text>
<text start="2772.33" dur="4.68">book you know in stand on stages like</text>
<text start="2773.8" dur="5.58">
this one and that was not so easy for me
</text>
<text start="2777.01" dur="4.71">
because you know as honored and
</text>
<text start="2779.38" dur="5.4">
delighted as I am to be in a group like
</text>
<text start="2781.72" dur="7.74">
this this stage this whole thing is not
</text>
<text start="2784.78" dur="8.28">
my natural milieu so I prepared for this
</text>
<text start="2789.46" dur="5.85">
year this time of talking about these
</text>
<text start="2793.06" dur="4.11">
ideas I prepared for it by practicing
</text>
<text start="2795.31" dur="4.14">public speaking every chance that I</text>
<text start="2797.17" dur="4.02">
could get you know and I won&#39;t a local
</text>
<text start="2799.45" dur="3.36">
Toastmasters which is this club where
</text>
<text start="2801.19" dur="3.75">
you practice speaking in a very
</text>
<text start="2802.81" dur="3.75">
supportive environment and I just ate it
</text>
<text start="2804.94" dur="4.02">
over and over and over again until it
</text>
<text start="2806.56" dur="8.19">
started to come more comfortably and
</text>
<text start="2808.96" dur="10.98">
that really helped a lot but what helped
</text>
<text start="2814.75" dur="6.17">
more than that is my feeling that right
</text>
<text start="2819.94" dur="3.84">now</text>
<text start="2820.92" dur="4.9">
we are actually poised on the brink of
</text>
<text start="2823.78" dur="4.74">
great dramatic change and that&#39;s really
</text>
<text start="2825.82" dur="4.05">
exciting to me we are poised on the
</text>
<text start="2828.52" dur="3.3">
brink of change in the way that we view
</text>
<text start="2829.87" dur="3.75">
introverts and I&#39;m telling you we are
</text>
<text start="2831.82" dur="4.2">
right now sitting today on one of the
</text>
<text start="2833.62" dur="7.22">
great on the great new diversity issue
</text>
<text start="2836.02" dur="7.44">of our time we all know the case for</text>
<text start="2840.84" dur="4.3">
women for gender diversity and we know
</text>
<text start="2843.46" dur="3.18">
the case for racial diversity and we
</text>
<text start="2845.14" dur="2.85">
know that these things are moral issues
</text>
<text start="2846.64" dur="2.37">
and they&#39;re business issues and it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2847.99" dur="3.27">
sort of the two things smushed together
</text>
<text start="2849.01" dur="2.95">
I want to say to you that the same exact
</text>
<text start="2851.26" dur="2.349">thing is too</text>
<text start="2851.96" dur="4.71">
the same thing is true for personality
</text>
<text start="2853.609" dur="5.281">diversity because we need the talents of</text>
<text start="2856.67" dur="4.47">
the quiet geniuses in our workplace and
</text>
<text start="2858.89" dur="4.02">
the great thing about this is that it

<text start="2861.14" dur="4.979">
doesn&#39;t take a lot of time and it
</text>
<text start="2862.91" dur="5.4">
doesn&#39;t cost a lot of money all it takes
</text>
<text start="2866.119" dur="3.031">
all it takes is thinking a little bit
</text>
<text start="2868.31" dur="5.58">differently</text>
<text start="2869.15" dur="7.34">
about what it means to be quiet thank
