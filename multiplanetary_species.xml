The alternative is to become a</text><text start="134.193" dur="1.423">space-faring civilization and a</text><text start="135.616" dur="2.807">multiplanet species, which I hope you</text><text start="138.423" dur="3.173">agree that is the right way to go.</text><text start="141.596" dur="1.472">Yes?</text><text start="143.068" dur="6.602">[APPLAUSE].</text><text start="149.67" dur="3.315">That&amp;#39;s what we want.</text><text start="152.985" dur="1.185">[APPLAUSE].</text><text start="154.17" dur="7.94">Yeah. So how do we figure out how to</text><text start="162.11" dur="4.23">take you to Mars and create a</text><text start="166.34" dur="4.26">self-sustaining city, a city that is not</text><text start="170.6" dur="1.43">really an outpost but can become a</text><text start="172.03" dur="3.25">planet in its own right and thus we can</text><text start="175.28" dur="4.71">become a truly multiplanet species?</text><text start="179.99" dur="1.38">You know, sometimes people wonder, Well,</text><text start="181.37" dur="2.461">what about other places in the solar</text><text start="183.831" dur="0.589">system?</text><text start="184.42" dur="3.03">Why Mars?</text><text start="187.45" dur="1.89">Well, just to sort of put things into</text><text start="189.34" dur="1.82">perspective, this is -- this is what --</text><text start="191.16" dur="2.03">this is an actual scale of what the</text><text start="193.19" dur="2.88">solar system looks like. So we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="196.07" dur="1.74">currently in the third little rock from</text><text start="197.81" dur="6.22">the left. That&amp;#39;s Earth. Yeah, exactly.</text><text start="204.03" dur="2.45">And our goal is to go to the fourth rock</text><text start="206.48" dur="3.11">on the left. That&amp;#39;s Mars. But you can</text><text start="209.59" dur="2.17">get a sense for the real scale of the</text><text start="211.76" dur="5.17">solar system, how big the sun is and</text><text start="216.93" dur="1.65">Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus. And</text><text start="218.58" dur="2.21">then the little guys on the right are</text><text start="220.79" dur="4.95">Pluto and friends.</text><text start="225.74" dur="2.59">This sort of helps to see, it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="228.33" dur="1.43">quite to scale, but it gives you a</text><text start="229.76" dur="3.34">better sense for where things are. So</text><text start="233.1" dur="2.91">our options for going to -- for becoming</text><text start="236.01" dur="2.99">a multiplanet species within our solar</text><text start="239" dur="3.28">system are limited. We have, in terms of</text><text start="242.28" dur="5.27">nearby options, we&amp;#39;ve got Venus. But</text><text start="247.55" dur="2.59">Venus is a high-pressure -- super</text><text start="250.14" dur="3.39">high-pressure hot acid bath. So that</text><text start="253.53" dur="2.3">would be a tricky one. Venus is not at</text><text start="255.83" dur="4.6">all like the goddess. This is not in no</text><text start="260.43" dur="4.45">way similar to the actual goddess.</text><text start="264.88" dur="1.853">So it is really difficult to make things</text><text start="266.733" dur="0.687">work on Venus.</text><text start="267.42" dur="4.39">Mercury is also way too close to the</text><text start="271.81" dur="2.54">sun. We could go potentially on to one</text><text start="274.35" dur="2.53">of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, but</text><text start="276.88" dur="1.49">those are quite far out, much further</text><text start="278.37" dur="2.04">from the sun, a lot harder to get to.</text><text start="280.41" dur="1.48">Really, it leaves us with one option if</text><text start="281.89" dur="2.07">we want to become a multiplanet</text><text start="283.96" dur="3.47">civilization, and that&amp;#39;s Mars. We could</text><text start="287.43" dur="3.17">conceivably go to our moon, and I have</text><text start="290.6" dur="2.87">nothing against going to the moon, but I</text><text start="293.47" dur="3.68">think it&amp;#39;s challenging to become</text><text start="297.15" dur="1.84">multiplanetary on the moon because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="298.99" dur="3.04">much smaller than a planet. It doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="302.03" dur="2.22">have any atmosphere. It&amp;#39;s not as</text><text start="304.25" dur="5.07">resource rich as Mars. It has a 28-day</text><text start="309.32" dur="3.52">day, whereas the Mars day is 24 1/2</text><text start="312.84" dur="1.92">hours. And in general, Mars is far</text><text start="314.76" dur="2.39">better suited to ultimately scale up to</text><text start="317.15" dur="3.74">a self-sustaining civilization.</text><text start="320.89" dur="6.2">Just to give some comparison between the</text><text start="327.09" dur="2.89">two planets, there are actually --</text><text start="329.98" dur="1.39">they&amp;#39;re remarkably close in a lot of</text><text start="331.37" dur="3.91">ways. In fact, we now believe that early</text><text start="335.28" dur="2.84">Mars was a lot like Earth. And, in fact,</text><text start="338.12" dur="2.26">if we could warm Mars up, we would, once</text><text start="340.38" dur="1.66">again, have a thick -- a thick</text><text start="342.04" dur="4.07">atmosphere and liquid oceans.</text><text start="346.11" dur="2.42">So, where things are right now, Mars is</text><text start="348.53" dur="3.01">about half again as far from the sun as</text><text start="351.54" dur="4.84">Earth. So it has decent sunlight. It&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="356.38" dur="4.94">little cold, but we can warm it up. It</text><text start="361.32" dur="2.85">has a very helpful atmosphere which, in</text><text start="364.17" dur="2.8">the case of Mars being primarily CO2</text><text start="366.97" dur="1.62">with some nitrogen and argon and a few</text><text start="368.59" dur="2.55">other trace elements, means that we can</text><text start="371.14" dur="4.48">grow plants on Mars just by compressing</text><text start="375.62" dur="2.31">the atmosphere. And it has nitrogen,</text><text start="377.93" dur="2.591">too, which is also very important for</text><text start="380.521" dur="1.019">growing plants.</text><text start="381.54" dur="1.76">It will be quite fun to be on Mars,</text><text start="383.3" dur="4.608">because you will have gravity which is</text><text start="387.908" dur="2.602">about 37% that of Earth, so you will be</text><text start="390.51" dur="1.89">able to lift heavy things and bound</text><text start="392.4" dur="3.64">around and have a lot of fun. And the</text><text start="396.04" dur="4.841">day is remarkably close to that of</text><text start="400.881" dur="0.389">Earth.</text><text start="401.27" dur="1.51">So we just need to change that bottom</text><text start="402.78" dur="2.29">row, because currently we have 7 billion</text><text start="405.07" dur="6.18">people on Earth and zero on Mars.</text><text start="411.25" dur="2.6">So there&amp;#39;s been a lot of great work by</text><text start="413.85" dur="2.2">NASA and other organizations in early</text><text start="416.05" dur="4.25">exploration of Mars and understanding</text><text start="420.3" dur="2.67">what Mars is like, where could we land,</text><text start="422.97" dur="3.23">what&amp;#39;s the composition of the</text><text start="426.2" dur="2.86">atmosphere, where is there water, or</text><text start="429.06" dur="4.21">ice, we should say. And we need to go</text><text start="433.27" dur="2.66">from these early exploration missions to</text><text start="435.93" dur="4.75">actually building a city.</text><text start="440.68" dur="2.85">The issue that we have today is that if</text><text start="443.53" dur="4.07">you look at a Venn diagram, there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="447.6" dur="1.74">intersection of sets of people who want</text><text start="449.34" dur="3.25">to go and can afford to go. In fact,</text><text start="452.59" dur="5.99">right now you cannot go to Mars for</text><text start="458.58" dur="2.71">infinite money. Using traditional</text><text start="461.29" dur="1.18">methods, you know, if taking sort of a</text><text start="462.47" dur="3.59">holistic style approach, an optimistic</text><text start="466.06" dur="3.18">cost number would be about $10 billion</text><text start="469.24" dur="3.41">per person. For example, the Apollo</text><text start="472.65" dur="1.78">program, the cost estimates are</text><text start="474.43" dur="2.97">somewhere between $100 billion to $200</text><text start="477.4" dur="3.15">billion in current-year dollars, and we</text><text start="480.55" dur="1.58">sent 12 people to the surface of the</text><text start="482.13" dur="2.99">moon, which was an incredible thing and</text><text start="485.12" dur="2.68">I think probably one of the greatest</text><text start="487.8" dur="2.53">achievements of humanity.</text><text start="490.33" dur="2.32">But that&amp;#39;s -- that&amp;#39;s a steep price to</text><text start="492.65" dur="2.19">pay for a ticket. That&amp;#39;s why these</text><text start="494.84" dur="4.47">circles only just barely touch. So you</text><text start="499.31" dur="1.03">can&amp;#39;t create a self-sustaining</text><text start="500.34" dur="3.37">civilization if the ticket price is $10</text><text start="503.71" dur="2.83">billion a person. What we need is a</text><text start="506.54" dur="1.8">closer -- is to move those circles</text><text start="508.34" dur="3.12">together. And if we can get the cost of</text><text start="511.46" dur="2.68">moving to Mars to be roughly equivalent</text><text start="514.14" dur="4.19">to a median house price in the U.S.,</text><text start="518.33" dur="3.17">which is around $200,000, then I think</text><text start="521.5" dur="1.87">the probability of establishing a</text><text start="523.37" dur="2.16">self-sustaining civilization is very</text><text start="525.53" dur="2.7">high. I think it would almost certainly</text><text start="528.23" dur="1.16">occur -- not everyone would want to go.</text><text start="529.39" dur="1.99">In fact, I think a relatively small</text><text start="531.38" dur="1.91">number of people from Earth would want</text><text start="533.29" dur="1.93">to go. But enough would want to go and</text><text start="535.22" dur="1.81">who could afford the trip that it would</text><text start="537.03" dur="1.8">happen. And people could get</text><text start="538.83" dur="3.8">sponsorship. And I think it gets to the</text><text start="542.63" dur="2.96">point where almost anyone, if they saved</text><text start="545.59" dur="2.11">up and this was their goal, they could</text><text start="547.7" dur="2.41">ultimately save up enough money to buy a</text><text start="550.11" dur="3.35">ticket and move to Mars. And Mars would</text><text start="553.46" dur="2.2">have labor shortage for a long time so</text><text start="555.66" dur="5.23">jobs would not be in short supply.</text><text start="560.89" dur="2.92">But it is a bit tricky because we have</text><text start="563.81" dur="2.87">to figure out how to improve the cost of</text><text start="566.68" dur="3.3">trips to Mars by 5 million percent. So</text><text start="569.98" dur="4.35">this is -- this is not easy. I mean,</text><text start="574.33" dur="1.37">it&amp;#39;s -- and it sounds like virtually</text><text start="575.7" dur="3.434">impossible but I think there are ways to</text><text start="579.134" dur="1.942">do it. This translates to an improvement</text><text start="581.076" dur="1.729">of approximately 4 1/2 orders of</text><text start="582.805" dur="3.435">magnitude.</text><text start="586.24" dur="1.44">These are the key elements that are</text><text start="587.68" dur="4.02">needed in order to achieve the 4 1/2</text><text start="591.7" dur="3.2">order of magnitude improvement. Most of</text><text start="594.9" dur="1.57">the improvement would come from full</text><text start="596.47" dur="2.142">reusability, somewhere between 2 and 2</text><text start="598.612" dur="2.808">1/2 orders of magnitude. And then the</text><text start="601.42" dur="1.68">other two orders of magnitude would come</text><text start="603.1" dur="2.46">from refilling in orbit, propellant</text><text start="605.56" dur="2.11">production on Mars and choosing the</text><text start="607.67" dur="3.21">right propellant. So I&amp;#39;m going to go</text><text start="610.88" dur="2.1">into detail on all of those.</text><text start="612.98" dur="3.21">Full reusability is really the super</text><text start="616.19" dur="3.59">hard one. It&amp;#39;s very difficult to achieve</text><text start="619.78" dur="3.34">reusability for even an orbital system,</text><text start="623.12" dur="2.78">and that challenge becomes even</text><text start="625.9" dur="2.36">substantially greater for a system that</text><text start="628.26" dur="5.87">has to go to another planet. But as an</text><text start="634.13" dur="1.79">example of the difference between</text><text start="635.92" dur="1.98">reusability and expendability in</text><text start="637.9" dur="2.76">aircraft -- and you can actually use any</text><text start="640.66" dur="4.01">form of transport. You could say a car,</text><text start="644.67" dur="1.68">bicycle, horse. If they were single-use,</text><text start="646.35" dur="2.93">almost no one would use them. It would</text><text start="649.28" dur="2.4">be too expensive. But with frequent</text><text start="651.68" dur="2.35">flights, you can take something like an</text><text start="654.03" dur="3.85">aircraft that costs $90 million and if</text><text start="657.88" dur="1.36">it was single use, you would have to pay</text><text start="659.24" dur="2.7">half a million dollars per flight. But</text><text start="661.94" dur="1.89">you can actually buy a ticket on</text><text start="663.83" dur="3.56">Southwest right now from L.A. to Vegas</text><text start="667.39" dur="5.28">for $43, including taxes. So that&amp;#39;s -- I</text><text start="672.67" dur="1.14">mean, that&amp;#39;s a massive improvement.</text><text start="673.81" dur="1.92">Right there it&amp;#39;s showing a four order of</text><text start="675.73" dur="1.21">magnitude improvement.</text><text start="676.94" dur="2.29">Now this is harder -- the reusability</text><text start="679.23" dur="2">doesn&amp;#39;t apply quite as much to Mars</text><text start="681.23" dur="2.19">because the number of times they can</text><text start="683.42" dur="3.16">reuse the spaceship is -- the spaceship</text><text start="686.58" dur="3.53">part of the system is less often because</text><text start="690.11" dur="1.67">the Earth-Mars rendezvous only occurs</text><text start="691.78" dur="2.25">every -- every 26 months.</text><text start="694.03" dur="2.08">So you get to use the spaceship part</text><text start="696.11" dur="1.5">roughly every two years.</text><text start="697.61" dur="2.67">Now, you get to use the booster and the</text><text start="700.28" dur="4.16">tanker as frequently as you&amp;#39;d like. And</text><text start="704.44" dur="2.62">so it makes -- that&amp;#39;s why it makes a lot</text><text start="707.06" dur="1.51">of sense to load the spaceship into</text><text start="708.57" dur="2.56">orbit with essentially tanks dry and</text><text start="711.13" dur="3.88">have it have really quite big tanks that</text><text start="715.01" dur="1.72">you then use the booster and tanker to</text><text start="716.73" dur="4">refill while it&amp;#39;s in orbit and maximize</text><text start="720.73" dur="1.939">the payload of the spaceships that when</text><text start="722.669" dur="2.151">it goes to Mars, you really have a very</text><text start="724.82" dur="8.02">large payload capability.</text><text start="732.84" dur="1.83">So as I said, refilling in orbit is one</text><text start="734.67" dur="2.69">of the essential elements of this.</text><text start="737.36" dur="2.61">Without refilling in orbit, you would</text><text start="739.97" dur="3.26">have a half order of magnitude impact</text><text start="743.23" dur="3.12">roughly on the cost. By &amp;quot;half order of</text><text start="746.35" dur="2.16">magnitude,&amp;quot; I think the audience mostly</text><text start="748.51" dur="2.78">knows, but what that means is each order</text><text start="751.29" dur="3.89">of magnitude is a factor of ten. So not</text><text start="755.18" dur="3.25">refilling in orbit would mean a 500%,</text><text start="758.43" dur="3.402">roughly, increase in the cost per</text><text start="761.832" dur="0.808">ticket.</text><text start="762.64" dur="2.04">It also allows us to build a smaller</text><text start="764.68" dur="2.24">vehicle and lower the development cost,</text><text start="766.92" dur="3.84">although this vehicle is quite big. But</text><text start="770.76" dur="2.709">it would be much harder to build</text><text start="773.469" dur="2.471">something that&amp;#39;s five to ten times the</text><text start="775.94" dur="1.97">size. And it also reduces the</text><text start="777.91" dur="2.48">sensitivity of performance</text><text start="780.39" dur="2.55">characteristics of the booster rocket</text><text start="782.94" dur="3.83">and tanker. So if there&amp;#39;s a shortfall in</text><text start="786.77" dur="1.82">the performance of any of the elements,</text><text start="788.59" dur="1.35">you can actually make up for it by</text><text start="789.94" dur="5.27">having one or two extra refilling trips</text><text start="795.21" dur="1.93">to the spaceship.

The rocket booster and the</text><text start="1328.25" dur="2.52">spaceship take off, loads the spaceship</text><text start="1330.77" dur="2.15">into orbit. The rocket booster then</text><text start="1332.92" dur="2.29">comes back. It comes back quite quickly,</text><text start="1335.21" dur="3.85">within about 20 minutes. And so it can</text><text start="1339.06" dur="3.18">actually launch the tanker version of</text><text start="1342.24" dur="2.29">the spacecraft, which is essentially the</text><text start="1344.53" dur="2.84">same as the -- as the spaceship but</text><text start="1347.37" dur="1.86">filling up the unpressurized and</text><text start="1349.23" dur="2.15">pressurized cargo areas with propellant</text><text start="1351.38" dur="2.89">tanks. So they look almost identical.</text><text start="1354.27" dur="1.66">This also helps slow the development</text><text start="1355.93" dur="4.73">cost, which obviously will not be small.</text><text start="1360.66" dur="1.69">And then the propellant tanker goes up.</text><text start="1362.35" dur="1.27">It will go -- actually, it will go up</text><text start="1363.62" dur="1.48">multiple times, anywhere from three to</text><text start="1365.1" dur="3.41">five times, to fill the tanks of the</text><text start="1368.51" dur="3.64">spaceship in orbit.

And</text><text start="1661.85" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s only recently that we think the</text><text start="1665.85" dur="2.63">carbon fiber technology has gotten to</text><text start="1668.48" dur="1.77">the point where we can actually do this</text><text start="1670.25" dur="3.09">without having to create a liner, some</text><text start="1673.34" dur="2.07">sort of metal liner, quad liner on the</text><text start="1675.41" dur="1.53">inside of the tanks, which would add</text><text start="1676.94" dur="2.83">mass and complexity.</text><text start="1679.77" dur="1.97">It&amp;#39;s particularly tricky for the hot</text><text start="1681.74" dur="2.04">gaseous oxygen pressurization.</text><text start="1683.78" dur="2.29">So this is designed to be autogenously</text><text start="1686.07" dur="4.61">pressurized, which means that the fuel</text><text start="1690.68" dur="2.45">and the oxygen, we gasify them through</text><text start="1693.13" dur="2.25">heat exchanges in the engine and use</text><text start="1695.38" dur="1.88">that to pressurize the tanks.

Use that to pressurize the</text><text start="1703.056" dur="1.164">oxygen tank.</text><text start="1704.22" dur="2.62">This is a much simpler system than what</text><text start="1706.84" dur="3.31">we have with Falcon 9, where we use</text><text start="1710.15" dur="3.88">helium for pressurization and we use</text><text start="1714.03" dur="3.15">nitrogen for gas thrusters. In this</text><text start="1717.18" dur="2.25">case, we would autogenously pressurize</text><text start="1719.43" dur="5.03">and then use gaseous methane and oxygen</text><text start="1724.46" dur="2.49">for the control thrusters.</text><text start="1726.95" dur="2.25">So really, you only need two ingredients</text><text start="1729.2" dur="3.69">for this, as opposed to four in the case</text><text start="1732.89" dur="2.43">of Falcon 9 and actually five if you</text><text start="1735.32" dur="9.37">consider the ignition liquid.

I don&amp;#39;t know if you can</text><text start="1765.41" dur="2.38">actually read that.

So it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1829.81" dur="1.56">the first time a rocket&amp;#39;s sort of</text><text start="1831.37" dur="3.54">performance bar will actually exceed the</text><text start="1834.91" dur="6.91">physical size of the rocket.</text><text start="1841.82" dur="4.42">This gives you a more direct sort of</text><text start="1846.24" dur="3.32">comparison. This is -- the thrust that</text><text start="1849.56" dur="5.42">is quite enormous, talking about liftoff</text><text start="1854.98" dur="2.39">thrusts of 13,000 tons. So it&amp;#39;s quite</text><text start="1857.37" dur="3.15">tectonic when it takes off. But it is --</text><text start="1860.52" dur="6.17">it is a fit on Pad 39A, which NASA has</text><text start="1866.69" dur="3.7">been kind enough to allow us to use,</text><text start="1870.39" dur="1.66">where -- because they somewhat oversized</text><text start="1872.05" dur="2.41">the pad in doing Saturn 5 and, as a</text><text start="1874.46" dur="1.77">result, we can actually do a much larger</text><text start="1876.23" dur="2.58">vehicle on that same launch pad. And in</text><text start="1878.81" dur="2.66">the future, we expect to add additional</text><text start="1881.47" dur="3.52">launch locations, probably adding one on</text><text start="1884.99" dur="3.16">the south coast of Texas.</text><text start="1888.15" dur="1.99">But this gives you a sense of the</text><text start="1890.14" dur="6.624">relative capability, if you can read</text><text start="1896.764" dur="0.736">those.</text><text start="1897.5" dur="4.44">But these vehicles have very different</text><text start="1901.94" dur="1.56">purposes. This is really intended to</text><text start="1903.5" dur="3.36">carry huge numbers of people, ultimately</text><text start="1906.86" dur="3.13">millions of tons of cargo to Mars. So</text><text start="1909.99" dur="1.8">you really need something quite large in</text><text start="1911.79" dur="1.604">order to do that.</text><text start="1913.394" dur="5.536">So talk about some of the key elements</text><text start="1918.93" dur="2.05">of the interplanetary spaceship and</text><text start="1920.98" dur="2.83">rocket booster. We decided to start off</text><text start="1923.81" dur="2.54">the development with what we think are</text><text start="1926.35" dur="3.71">probably the two most difficult elements</text><text start="1930.06" dur="4.93">of the design. One is the Raptor engine.</text><text start="1934.99" dur="2.03">And this is going to be the highest</text><text start="1937.02" dur="3.02">chamber pressure engine of any kind ever</text><text start="1940.04" dur="5.923">built and probably the highest</text><text start="1945.963" dur="0.847">thrust-to-weight.</text><text start="1946.81" dur="2.86">It&amp;#39;s a full-flow staged combustion</text><text start="1949.67" dur="3.55">engine which maximizes the theoretical</text><text start="1953.22" dur="2.79">momentum that you can get out of a given</text><text start="1956.01" dur="4.94">source fuel and oxidizer. We subcool the</text><text start="1960.95" dur="4.81">oxygen and methane to densify it. So</text><text start="1965.76" dur="2.02">compared to when -- propellants normally</text><text start="1967.78" dur="2.02">use close to their boiling point in most</text><text start="1969.8" dur="2.29">rockets. In our case, we actually build</text><text start="1972.09" dur="2.34">the propellants close to their freezing</text><text start="1974.43" dur="2.16">point. That can result in a density</text><text start="1976.59" dur="2.82">improvement of up to around 10 to 12%,</text><text start="1979.41" dur="1.44">which makes an enormous difference in</text><text start="1980.85" dur="3.63">the actual results of the rocket. It</text><text start="1984.48" dur="2.32">also makes the -- it gets rid of any</text><text start="1986.8" dur="2.07">cavitation risk for the turbo pumps and</text><text start="1988.87" dur="1.19">it makes it easier to feed a</text><text start="1990.06" dur="1.47">high-pressure turbo pump if you have</text><text start="1991.53" dur="6.38">very cold propellant.</text><text start="1997.91" dur="3.05">Really one of the keys here, though, is</text><text start="2000.96" dur="4.097">the vacuum version of Raptor having a</text><text start="2005.057" dur="4.073">382-second ISP. This is really quite</text><text start="2009.13" dur="3.94">critical too to the whole Mars mission.</text><text start="2013.07" dur="1.635">And we can get to that number or at</text><text start="2014.705" dur="1.565">least within a few seconds of that</text><text start="2016.27" dur="5.649">number, ultimately maybe exceeding it</text><text start="2021.919" dur="2.251">slightly.</text><text start="2024.17" dur="1.94">So the rocket booster in many ways is</text><text start="2026.11" dur="2.03">really a scaled-up version of the Falcon</text><text start="2028.14" dur="2.62">9 booster. You will see a lot of</text><text start="2030.76" dur="3.13">similarities, such as the grid fins.</text><text start="2033.89" dur="4.458">Obviously clustering a lot of engines at</text><text start="2038.348" dur="1.852">the base. And the big difference really</text><text start="2040.2" dur="2.14">being that the primary structure is an</text><text start="2042.34" dur="2.24">advanced form of carbon fiber as opposed</text><text start="2044.58" dur="2.67">to limited lithium and that we use</text><text start="2047.25" dur="5.2">autogenous pressurization and get rid of</text><text start="2052.45" dur="3.4">the helium and the nitrogen.</text><text start="2055.85" dur="3.8">So this uses 42 Raptor engines. It&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2059.65" dur="2.36">lot of engines, but we use an I.N. on</text><text start="2062.01" dur="2.1">the Falcon 9. And with Falcon Heavy,</text><text start="2064.11" dur="3.34">which should launch early next year,</text><text start="2067.45" dur="2.8">there&amp;#39;s 27 engines on the base. So we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="2070.25" dur="1.93">got pretty good experience with having a</text><text start="2072.18" dur="1.88">large number of engines. It also gives</text><text start="2074.06" dur="1.49">us redundancies. So that if some of the</text><text start="2075.55" dur="4.112">engines fail, you can still continue the</text><text start="2079.662" dur="1.778">mission and be fine.</text><text start="2081.44" dur="3.19">But the main job of the booster is to</text><text start="2084.63" dur="4.69">accelerate the spaceship to around 8 1/2</text><text start="2089.32" dur="3.57">thousand kilometers an hour. For those</text><text start="2092.89" dur="3.8">that are less familiar with orbital</text><text start="2096.69" dur="2.71">dynamics, really it&amp;#39;s all about velocity</text><text start="2099.4" dur="3.19">and not about height. So really that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2102.59" dur="2.01">the job of the booster. The booster is</text><text start="2104.6" dur="2.55">like the javelin thrower. You&amp;#39;ve got to</text><text start="2107.15" dur="3.748">toss that javelin, which is the</text><text start="2110.898" dur="1.312">spaceship.</text><text start="2112.21" dur="3.9">In the case of other planets, though,</text><text start="2116.11" dur="2.7">which have a gravity well which is not</text><text start="2118.81" dur="4.37">as deep, so Mars, the moons of Jupiter,</text><text start="2123.18" dur="4.06">conceivably maybe even one day Venus --</text><text start="2127.24" dur="1.67">the -- well, Venus will be a little</text><text start="2128.91" dur="3.92">trickier. But for most of the solar</text><text start="2132.83" dur="2.04">system, you only need the spaceship. So</text><text start="2134.87" dur="1.99">you don&amp;#39;t need the booster if you have a</text><text start="2136.86" dur="1.83">lower gravity well. No booster is needed</text><text start="2138.69" dur="2.67">on the moon or Mars or any of the moons</text><text start="2141.36" dur="2.55">of Jupiter or Pluto. You just need the</text><text start="2143.91" dur="2.17">spaceship. The booster is just there for</text><text start="2146.08" dur="5.13">heavy gravity wells.</text><text start="2151.21" dur="1.31">And then we&amp;#39;ve also been able to</text><text start="2152.52" dur="1.98">optimize the propellant needed for</text><text start="2154.5" dur="4.35">boost-back and landing to get it down to</text><text start="2158.85" dur="2.76">about 7% of the liftoff prop propellant</text><text start="2161.61" dur="1.85">load. We think with some optimization</text><text start="2163.46" dur="1.97">maybe we can get it down to about 6%.</text><text start="2165.43" dur="3.04">And we also are now getting quite</text><text start="2168.47" dur="0.75">comfortable with the accuracy of the</text><text start="2169.22" dur="3.42">landing. If you have been watching the</text><text start="2172.64" dur="1.231">Falcon 9 landings, you will see that</text><text start="2173.871" dur="2.15">they are getting increasingly closer too</text><text start="2176.021" dur="2.026">to the bull&amp;#39;s-eye. And we think,</text><text start="2178.047" dur="1.199">particularly with the addition of</text><text start="2179.246" dur="2.023">additional -- with the addition of some</text><text start="2181.269" dur="2.241">thrusters and maneuvering thrusters, we</text><text start="2183.51" dur="2.114">can actually put the booster right back</text><text start="2185.624" dur="2.286">on the launch stand. And then those fins</text><text start="2187.91" dur="3.38">at the base are essentially centering</text><text start="2191.29" dur="3.14">features to take out any minor position</text><text start="2194.43" dur="7.46">mismatch at the launch site.</text><text start="2201.89" dur="2.89">So that&amp;#39;s what it looks like at the</text><text start="2204.78" dur="1.99">base. So we think we only need to gimbal</text><text start="2206.77" dur="3.63">or steer the center cluster of engines.</text><text start="2210.4" dur="1.31">There&amp;#39;s seven engines in the center</text><text start="2211.71" dur="2.57">cluster. Those would be the ones that</text><text start="2214.28" dur="1.59">move for steering the rocket, and the</text><text start="2215.87" dur="2.22">other ones would be fixed in position,</text><text start="2218.09" dur="2.094">which gives us the best concentration of</text><text start="2220.184" dur="2.706">-- we can max out the number of engines</text><text start="2222.89" dur="1.67">because we don&amp;#39;t have to leave any room</text><text start="2224.56" dur="3.73">for gimbaling or moving the engines.</text><text start="2228.29" dur="1.83">And, like, this is all designed so that</text><text start="2230.12" dur="3.7">you could actually lose multiple engines</text><text start="2233.82" dur="1.91">even at liftoff or anywhere in flight</text><text start="2235.73" dur="7.17">and continue the mission safely.</text><text start="2242.9" dur="5.34">So for the spaceship itself, in the top,</text><text start="2248.24" dur="1.3">we have the pressurized compartment. And</text><text start="2249.54" dur="2.46">I&amp;#39;ll show you a fly-through of that in a</text><text start="2252" dur="1.23">moment. And then beneath that is the --</text><text start="2253.23" dur="1.82">is where we would have the unpressurized</text><text start="2255.05" dur="1.95">cargo, which would be really flat packed</text><text start="2257" dur="2.97">in a very dense format.</text><text start="2259.97" dur="3.79">And then below that is the liquid oxygen</text><text start="2263.76" dur="2.13">tank. The liquid oxygen tank is probably</text><text start="2265.89" dur="3.71">the hardest piece of this whole vehicle</text><text start="2269.6" dur="1.62">because it&amp;#39;s got to handle propellant at</text><text start="2271.22" dur="2.99">the coldest level and the tanks</text><text start="2274.21" dur="3.48">themselves actually form the air frame.</text><text start="2277.69" dur="2.61">So the air frame structure and the tank</text><text start="2280.3" dur="3.64">structure are combined, as it is in all</text><text start="2283.94" dur="3.85">modern rockets. And in aircraft, for</text><text start="2287.79" dur="2.21">example, the wing is really a fuel tank</text><text start="2290" dur="2.781">in wing shape. So it has to take the</text><text start="2292.781" dur="5.675">thrust loads of ascents, the loads of</text><text start="2298.456" dur="3.074">reentry, and then it has to be</text><text start="2301.53" dur="4.55">impermeable to gaseous oxygen, which is</text><text start="2306.08" dur="1.53">tricky, and non-reactive to gaseous</text><text start="2307.61" dur="3.66">oxygen. So that&amp;#39;s the hardest piece of</text><text start="2311.27" dur="1.66">the spaceship itself, which is actually</text><text start="2312.93" dur="2.182">why we started on that element as well.</text><text start="2315.112" dur="2.848">And I&amp;#39;ll show you some pictures of that</text><text start="2317.96" dur="0.19">later.</text><text start="2318.15" dur="2.36">And then below the oxygen tank is the</text><text start="2320.51" dur="1.93">fuel tank, and then the engines are</text><text start="2322.44" dur="3.81">mounted directly to the thrust cone on</text><text start="2326.25" dur="3.05">the base. And then there are six of the</text><text start="2329.3" dur="2.56">vacuum -- the high efficiency vacuum</text><text start="2331.86" dur="2.24">engines around the perimeter, and those</text><text start="2334.1" dur="3.44">don&amp;#39;t gimbal. And then there are three</text><text start="2337.54" dur="2.33">of the sea-level versions of the engine</text><text start="2339.87" dur="1">which do gimbal and provide the</text><text start="2340.87" dur="3.27">steering. Although we can do some amount</text><text start="2344.14" dur="2.06">of steering if you&amp;#39;re in space with</text><text start="2346.2" dur="2.807">differential thrust on the outside</text><text start="2349.007" dur="0.733">engines.</text><text start="2349.74" dur="5.23">The net effect is a cargo to Mars of up</text><text start="2354.97" dur="4.27">to 450 tons, depending upon how many</text><text start="2359.24" dur="4.5">refills you do with the tanker. And the</text><text start="2363.74" dur="1.78">goal is at least 100 passengers per</text><text start="2365.52" dur="2.15">ship. Although I think we will see that</text><text start="2367.67" dur="2.752">number grow to 200 or more.</text><text start="2370.422" dur="3.438">This chart is a little difficult to</text><text start="2373.86" dur="2.53">interpret at first, but we decided to</text><text start="2376.39" dur="1.299">put it there for people who wanted to</text><text start="2377.689" dur="1.771">watch the video afterwards and sort of</text><text start="2379.46" dur="4.45">take a closer look and analyze some of</text><text start="2383.91" dur="0.44">the numbers.</text><text start="2384.35" dur="1.89">The column on the left is probably</text><text start="2386.24" dur="3.14">what&amp;#39;s most relevant. And that gives you</text><text start="2389.38" dur="4.06">the trip time. So depending upon which</text><text start="2393.44" dur="1.73">Earth-Mars rendezvous you are aiming</text><text start="2395.17" dur="3.37">for, the trip time at 6 kilometers per</text><text start="2398.54" dur="2.32">second departure blast speed can be as</text><text start="2400.86" dur="3.12">low as 80 days. And then over time, I</text><text start="2403.98" dur="3.99">think we could probably improve that.</text><text start="2407.97" dur="3.03">Ultimately, I suspect that you would see</text><text start="2411" dur="3.08">Mars transit times of as little as 30</text><text start="2414.08" dur="4.07">days in the more distant future.</text><text start="2418.15" dur="1.7">It&amp;#39;s fairly manageable, considering the</text><text start="2419.85" dur="2.25">trips that people used to do in the old</text><text start="2422.1" dur="1.09">days would routinely take sailing</text><text start="2423.19" dur="6.803">voyages that would be six months or</text><text start="2429.993" dur="0.817">more.</text><text start="2430.81" dur="1.41">So on arrival, the heat shield</text><text start="2432.22" dur="2.54">technology is extremely important.

And we</text><text start="2608.97" dur="1.45">think, based on this architecture, this</text><text start="2610.42" dur="2.42">architecture, assuming optimization over</text><text start="2612.84" dur="2.71">time, like the very first flights would</text><text start="2615.55" dur="2.28">be fairly expensive. But the</text><text start="2617.83" dur="3.67">architecture allows for a cost per</text><text start="2621.5" dur="3.21">ticket of less than $200,000, maybe as</text><text start="2624.71" dur="3.45">less -- maybe as little as $100,000 over</text><text start="2628.16" dur="2.37">time, depending upon how much mass a</text><text start="2630.53" dur="3.04">person takes. So we&amp;#39;re right now</text><text start="2633.57" dur="3.67">estimating about $140,000 per ton to the</text><text start="2637.24" dur="1.93">trips to Mars. So if a person plus their</text><text start="2639.17" dur="3.43">luggage is less than that, take into</text><text start="2642.6" dur="2.13">account food consumption and life</text><text start="2644.73" dur="3.77">support, then we think that the cost of</text><text start="2648.5" dur="10.41">moving to Mars ultimately could drop</text><text start="2658.91" dur="1.31">below $100,000.</text><text start="2660.22" dur="4.51">So funding, talking about funding</text><text start="2664.73" dur="1.2">sources.

So obviously it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2675.59" dur="5.47">going to be a challenge to fund this</text><text start="2681.06" dur="5.48">whole endeavor. We do expect to generate</text><text start="2686.54" dur="2.18">pretty decent net cash flow from</text><text start="2688.72" dur="3.18">launching lots of satellites and serving</text><text start="2691.9" dur="4.44">the space station for NASA, transferring</text><text start="2696.34" dur="3.99">cargo to and from space station, and</text><text start="2700.33" dur="1.55">then I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people in</text><text start="2701.88" dur="1.63">the private sector who are interested in</text><text start="2703.51" dur="3.29">helping fund a base on Mars and then</text><text start="2706.8" dur="3.46">perhaps there will be interest on the</text><text start="2710.26" dur="2.61">government sector side to also do that.</text><text start="2712.87" dur="3.39">Ultimately, this is going to be a huge</text><text start="2716.26" dur="4.01">public-private partnership.

Not the best at this sort of</text><text start="2795.957" dur="8.275">thing. But just to show you where we</text><text start="2804.232" dur="4.92">started off. In 2002, SpaceX basically</text><text start="2809.152" dur="4.241">consisted of carpet and a mariachi band.</text><text start="2813.393" dur="3.067">That was it. That&amp;#39;s all of SpaceX in</text><text start="2816.46" dur="2.656">2002. As you can see, I&amp;#39;m a dancing</text><text start="2819.116" dur="7.14">machine. And, yeah, I believe in kicking</text><text start="2826.256" dur="2.474">off celebratory events with mariachi</text><text start="2828.73" dur="3.75">bands. I really like mariachi bands.</text><text start="2832.48" dur="1.911">But that was what we started off with in</text><text start="2834.391" dur="3.73">2002. And really, I mean, I thought we</text><text start="2838.121" dur="3.036">had maybe a 10% chance of doing</text><text start="2841.157" dur="2.146">anything, of even getting a rocket to</text><text start="2843.303" dur="2.697">orbit, let alone getting beyond that and</text><text start="2846" dur="5.97">taking Mars seriously. But I came to the</text><text start="2851.97" dur="1.72">conclusion if there wasn&amp;#39;t some new</text><text start="2853.69" dur="5.2">entrant into the space arena with a</text><text start="2858.89" dur="3.34">strong ideological motivation, then it</text><text start="2862.23" dur="3.09">didn&amp;#39;t seem like we were on a trajectory</text><text start="2865.32" dur="1.64">to ever be a space-faring civilization</text><text start="2866.96" dur="2.176">and be out there among the stars.</text><text start="2869.136" dur="2.074">Because, you know, in &amp;#39;69 we were able</text><text start="2871.21" dur="1.79">to go to the moon and the space shuttle</text><text start="2873" dur="2.05">could get to low-Earth orbit, and then</text><text start="2875.05" dur="1.77">after the space shuttle got retired. But</text><text start="2876.82" dur="4.34">that trend line is down to zero.</text><text start="2881.16" dur="1.197">So I think what a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2882.357" dur="1.203">appreciate is that technology does not</text><text start="2883.56" dur="3.15">automatically improve.

So that</text><text start="2947.52" dur="5.156">lasted about 60 seconds, unfortunately.</text><text start="2952.676" dur="1.416">But it&amp;#39;s 2006, four years after</text><text start="2954.092" dur="1.601">starting, is also when we actually got</text><text start="2955.693" dur="3.311">our first NASA contract.

And then, finally, the fourth</text><text start="2993.3" dur="4.81">launch of Falcon 1 worked in 2008. And</text><text start="2998.11" dur="2.24">we were really down to our last pennies.</text><text start="3000.35" dur="2.22">In fact, I only thought I had enough</text><text start="3002.57" dur="1.99">money for three launches and the first</text><text start="3004.56" dur="3.78">three bloody failed. And we were able to</text><text start="3008.34" dur="1.4">scrape together enough to just barely</text><text start="3009.74" dur="2.87">make it and do a fourth launch. And</text><text start="3012.61" dur="2.52">thank goodness that fourth launch</text><text start="3015.13" dur="5.522">succeeded in 2008. That was a lot of</text><text start="3020.652" dur="0.638">pain.</text><text start="3021.29" dur="2.39">And then also at the end of 2008 is when</text><text start="3023.68" dur="3.45">NASA awarded us the first major</text><text start="3027.13" dur="2.79">operational contract, which was for</text><text start="3029.92" dur="2.54">resupplying cargo to the space station</text><text start="3032.46" dur="3.087">and bringing cargo back.</text><text start="3035.547" dur="1.57">Then a couple years later we did the</text><text start="3037.117" dur="3.765">first launch of Falcon 9, version 1.

The</text><text start="3167.04" dur="3.972">landing on the ship is important for the</text><text start="3171.012" dur="1.368">very high-velocity geosynchronous</text><text start="3172.38" dur="2.05">missions. And that&amp;#39;s important for</text><text start="3174.43" dur="5.05">reusability of Falcon 9 because about</text><text start="3179.48" dur="4.08">roughly a quarter of our missions are</text><text start="3183.56" dur="3.34">sort of servicing the space station.

So we&amp;#39;ve got to</text><text start="3195.85" dur="2.14">do these high-velocity missions that</text><text start="3197.99" dur="2.81">really need to land on a ship out to</text><text start="3200.8" dur="2.2">sea.

But we were</text><text start="3220.89" dur="1.54">going to try to make as much progress as</text><text start="3222.43" dur="2.18">we can. Obviously, it&amp;#39;s with a very</text><text start="3224.61" dur="2.32">constrained budget. But we are going to</text><text start="3226.93" dur="3.153">try to make as much progress as we can</text><text start="3230.083" dur="4.697">on the elements of interplanetary</text><text start="3234.78" dur="3.89">transport booster and spaceship, and</text><text start="3238.67" dur="5.04">hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be able to complete the</text><text start="3243.71" dur="2.32">first development spaceship in maybe</text><text start="3246.03" dur="3.52">about four years and start doing</text><text start="3249.55" dur="2.28">suborbital flights with that.</text><text start="3251.83" dur="3.15">In fact, it has enough capability that</text><text start="3254.98" dur="3">you could maybe even go to orbit if you</text><text start="3257.98" dur="2.822">limit the amount of cargo with the</text><text start="3260.802" dur="1.905">spaceship. Well, you have to really --</text><text start="3262.707" dur="2.413">you have to really strip it down. But in</text><text start="3265.12" dur="1.52">tanker form, it could definitely get to</text><text start="3266.64" dur="5.07">orbit. It can&amp;#39;t get back, but it can get</text><text start="3271.71" dur="0.4">to orbit.</text><text start="3272.11" dur="2.04">Actually, I was thinking like maybe</text><text start="3274.15" dur="2.07">there is some market for really fast</text><text start="3276.22" dur="3.18">transport of stuff around the world,</text><text start="3279.4" dur="1.47">provided we can land somewhere where</text><text start="3280.87" dur="3.47">noise is not a super big deal, because</text><text start="3284.34" dur="3.3">rockets are very noisy. But we could</text><text start="3287.64" dur="4.53">transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in</text><text start="3292.17" dur="3.38">45 minutes at the longest. So most</text><text start="3295.55" dur="3.54">places on Earth would be maybe 20, 25</text><text start="3299.09" dur="3.81">minutes. So maybe if we had a floating</text><text start="3302.9" dur="3.58">platform off the coast of, you know, say</text><text start="3306.48" dur="4.1">-- off the coast of New York, say 20, 30</text><text start="3310.58" dur="5.12">miles out, could you go from New York to</text><text start="3315.7" dur="4.28">Tokyo in, I don&amp;#39;t know, 25 minutes;</text><text start="3319.98" dur="3.1">across the Atlantic in ten minutes.</text><text start="3323.08" dur="2.1">Really most of your time would be</text><text start="3325.18" dur="2.055">getting to the ship, and then it would</text><text start="3327.235" dur="1.745">be real quick after that.</text><text start="3328.98" dur="3.27">So there&amp;#39;s some intriguing possibilities</text><text start="3332.25" dur="2.86">there.

As</text><text start="3453.064" dur="2.367">a propulsive lander, you can go anywhere</text><text start="3455.431" dur="3.079">in the solar system. So you can go to</text><text start="3458.51" dur="1.69">the moon. You can go to -- well,</text><text start="3460.2" dur="2.83">anywhere, really. Whereas, if something</text><text start="3463.03" dur="3.53">relies on parachutes or wings, then you</text><text start="3466.56" dur="3.37">can pretty much only -- well, if it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3469.93" dur="1.81">wings, you can pretty much only land on</text><text start="3471.74" dur="1.2">Earth because you need a runway, and</text><text start="3472.94" dur="3.47">most places don&amp;#39;t have a runway.

And the Raptor is a really</text><text start="3525.78" dur="2.71">tricky engine. It&amp;#39;s a lot trickier than</text><text start="3528.49" dur="2.13">Merlin because it&amp;#39;s a full-flow stage</text><text start="3530.62" dur="4.137">combustion, much higher pressure.</text><text start="3534.757" dur="1.66">I&amp;#39;m kind of amazed it didn&amp;#39;t blow up on</text><text start="3536.417" dur="3.644">the first firing. Fortunately, it was</text><text start="3540.061" dur="10.423">good.</text><text start="3550.484" dur="1.111">It&amp;#39;s kind of interesting to see the mock</text><text start="3551.595" dur="2.728">diamonds forming.</text><text start="3554.323" dur="15.771">[APPLAUSE].</text><text start="3570.094" dur="1.659">And part of the reason for making the</text><text start="3571.753" dur="2.654">engine sort of small, Raptor, although</text><text start="3574.407" dur="1.322">it has three times the thrust of a</text><text start="3575.729" dur="3.587">Merlin is only about the same size as a</text><text start="3579.316" dur="1.897">Merlin engine because it has three times</text><text start="3581.213" dur="2.177">the operating pressure.</text><text start="3583.39" dur="1.426">That means we can use a lot of the</text><text start="3584.816" dur="1.714">production techniques that we&amp;#39;ve honed</text><text start="3586.53" dur="1.33">with Merlin.</text><text start="3587.86" dur="1.51">We are currently producing Merlin</text><text start="3589.37" dur="3.89">engines at almost 300 per year.

And this is a similarly sized</text><text start="3611.34" dur="1.47">engine to Merlin except for the</text><text start="3612.81" dur="3.04">expansion ratio. So we feel really</text><text start="3615.85" dur="1.28">comfortable about being able to make</text><text start="3617.13" dur="3.98">this engine in volume at a price that</text><text start="3621.11" dur="3.969">doesn&amp;#39;t break our budget.</text><text start="3625.079" dur="2.631">We also wanted to make progress on the</text><text start="3627.71" dur="3.38">primary structure. So, as I mentioned,</text><text start="3631.09" dur="5.21">this is really a very difficult thing to</text><text start="3636.3" dur="1.78">make, to make something out of carbon</text><text start="3638.08" dur="0.29">fiber.</text><text start="3638.37" dur="2.45">Even though carbon fiber has incredible</text><text start="3640.82" dur="6.58">strength-to-weight, when you want to</text><text start="3647.4" dur="1.79">then put super cold liquid oxygen or</text><text start="3649.19" dur="2.21">liquid methane -- particularly liquid</text><text start="3651.4" dur="3.68">oxygen -- in a tank, it&amp;#39;s subject to</text><text start="3655.08" dur="4.22">cracking and leaking, and it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="3659.3" dur="2.28">difficult to make. Just the sheer scale</text><text start="3661.58" dur="2.22">of it is also challenging, because</text><text start="3663.8" dur="1.98">you&amp;#39;ve got to lay out the carbon fiber</text><text start="3665.78" dur="2.13">in exactly the right way on a huge mold,</text><text start="3667.91" dur="5.002">and you&amp;#39;ve got to cure that mold at</text><text start="3672.912" dur="1.668">temperature.</text><text start="3674.58" dur="3.64">And then -- it&amp;#39;s just hard to make large</text><text start="3678.22" dur="1.88">carbon fiber structures that could do</text><text start="3680.1" dur="4.46">all of those things and carry incredible</text><text start="3684.56" dur="1.39">loads. So that&amp;#39;s the other thing we want</text><text start="3685.95" dur="4.01">to focus on is the Raptor and then</text><text start="3689.96" dur="3.43">building the first development tank for</text><text start="3693.39" dur="6.14">the Mars spaceship.</text><text start="3699.53" dur="1.89">So this is really the hardest part of</text><text start="3701.42" dur="2.95">the spaceship. The other pieces we have</text><text start="3704.37" dur="1.67">a pretty good handle on. But this was</text><text start="3706.04" dur="2.12">the trickiest one. We wanted to tackle</text><text start="3708.16" dur="0.5">it first.</text><text start="3708.66" dur="4.07">You get a size for how big the tank is,</text><text start="3712.73" dur="2.97">which is really quite big. Also big</text><text start="3715.7" dur="2.12">congratulations to the team that worked</text><text start="3717.82" dur="0.36">on that.</text><text start="3718.18" dur="1.65">They were also working seven days a week</text><text start="3719.83" dur="2.68">to try to get this done in advance of</text><text start="3722.51" dur="5.79">the IAC. We managed to build the first</text><text start="3728.3" dur="1.96">tank, and the initial tests with the</text><text start="3730.26" dur="1.86">cryogenic propellants actually look</text><text start="3732.12" dur="2.41">quite positive. We have not seen any</text><text start="3734.53" dur="3.53">leaks or major issues.</text><text start="3738.06" dur="6.28">This is what the tank looks like on the</text><text start="3744.34" dur="3.8">inside. So you can get a real sense for</text><text start="3748.14" dur="4.75">just how big this tank is. It&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="3752.89" dur="1.82">completely smooth on the inside, but the</text><text start="3754.71" dur="2.49">way that the carbon fiber plies lay out</text><text start="3757.2" dur="5.89">and reflect the light makes it look</text><text start="3763.09" dur="1.72">faceted.</text><text start="3764.81" dur="1.99">So then what about beyond Mars?</text><text start="3766.8" dur="2.91">So as we thought about the system -- and</text><text start="3769.71" dur="1.361">the reason we call it a system, because</text><text start="3771.071" dur="1.159">generally I don&amp;#39;t like calling things</text><text start="3772.23" dur="1.76">systems because everything is a system,</text><text start="3773.99" dur="5.46">including your dog -- is that -- is that</text><text start="3779.45" dur="3.14">it&amp;#39;s actually more than a vehicle.</text><text start="3782.59" dur="1.54">There&amp;#39;s obviously the rocket booster,</text><text start="3784.13" dur="5.49">the spaceship, the tanker, and the</text><text start="3789.62" dur="2.884">propellant plant, the in situ propellant</text><text start="3792.504" dur="0.926">production.</text><text start="3793.43" dur="2.79">If you have all of those four elements,</text><text start="3796.22" dur="2.28">you can actually go anywhere in the</text><text start="3798.5" dur="2.34">solar system by planet hopping or moon</text><text start="3800.84" dur="3.97">hopping. So by establishing a propellant</text><text start="3804.81" dur="2.82">depot on -- in the asteroid belt or on</text><text start="3807.63" dur="2.68">one of the moons of Jupiter, you can go</text><text start="3810.31" dur="3.67">to -- you can make flights from Mars to</text><text start="3813.98" dur="3.25">Jupiter no problem. In fact, even from</text><text start="3817.23" dur="1.42">-- even without a propellant depot at</text><text start="3818.65" dur="4.68">Mars, you can do a fly-by of Jupiter</text><text start="3823.33" dur="3.47">without a propellant depot.</text><text start="3826.8" dur="1.61">So -- but by establishing a propellant</text><text start="3828.41" dur="7.44">depot, let&amp;#39;s say, you know, Enceladus or</text><text start="3835.85" dur="4.57">Europa or -- there&amp;#39;s a few options, and</text><text start="3840.42" dur="3.57">then doing another one on Titan,</text><text start="3843.99" dur="3.04">Saturn&amp;#39;s moon, and then perhaps another</text><text start="3847.03" dur="5.56">one further out on Pluto or elsewhere in</text><text start="3852.59" dur="4.49">the solar system, this system really</text><text start="3857.08" dur="1.54">gives you freedom to go anywhere you</text><text start="3858.62" dur="2.4">want in the greater solar system.
